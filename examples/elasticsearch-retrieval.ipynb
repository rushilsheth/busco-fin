Form 10-K Summary 57 This Annual\\\\nReport on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements, within\\\\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that\\\\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking statements are\\\\nlocated in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Business” and\\\\nPart II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion\\\\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Forward-\\\\nlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\\\\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to\\\\nany historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K\\\\nregarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the\\\\nCompany’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.\\\\nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,”\\\\n“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\\\\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms.\\\\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the\\\\nCompany’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed\\\\nin the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences\\\\ninclude, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this\\\\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation\\\\nto revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as\\\\nrequired by law.

Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers\\\\ncollectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise\\\\nstated. PART I Item 1.

Accessories includes Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 1 Services Advertising The Company’s advertising\\\\nservices include third-party licensing arrangements and the Company’s own\\\\nadvertising platforms. AppleCare The Company offers a portfolio of fee-based\\\\nservice and support products under the AppleCare brand. The offerings provide\\\\npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple\\\\nauthorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many\\\\ncases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and\\\\nloss, depending on the country and type of product. Cloud Services The\\\\nCompany’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and\\\\navailable across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\\\\nDigital Content The Company operates various platforms, including the App\\\\nStore that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital\\\\ncontent, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. The Company also\\\\noffers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple\\\\nArcade , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized\\\\nfitness service; Apple Music , which offers users a curated listening\\\\nexperience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ , a subscription news\\\\nand magazine service; and Apple TV+ , which offers exclusive original content\\\\nand live sports. Payment Services The Company offers payment services,\\\\nincluding Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless\\\\npayment service. Segments The Company manages its business primarily on a\\\\ngeographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,\\\\nEurope, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both\\\\nNorth and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India,\\\\nthe Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries\\\\nnot included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the\\\\nreportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar\\\\nservices, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of\\\\nthe Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market\\\\ndynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company’s\\\\ncustomers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business,\\\\neducation, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products\\\\nand resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to\\\\ncustomers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The\\\\nCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as\\\\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.\\\\nDuring 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect\\\\ndistribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net\\\\nsales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are\\\\nhighly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and\\\\nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new\\\\nproducts and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\\\\ncontinual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\\\\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity\\\\non the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors\\\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost\\\\nstructures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\\\nintellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 The Company’s ability\\\\nto compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely\\\\nintroduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the\\\\nmarketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software\\\\napplications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to\\\\nthe Company include price, product and service features (including security\\\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\\\\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories\\\\necosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and\\\\ncorporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market\\\\nopportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\\\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in\\\\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software,\\\\nand service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the\\\\nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a\\\\nlarger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly\\\\nintense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures\\\\nto provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s\\\\nservices compete with business models that provide content to users for free\\\\nand use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\\\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate\\\\nthe Company’s product features and applications within their products, or\\\\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those\\\\nthey currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential\\\\nto the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources,\\\\ncertain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The\\\\nCompany also competes for various components with other participants in the\\\\nmarkets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and\\\\naccessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those\\\\nthat are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-\\\\nwide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses\\\\nsome custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new\\\\nproducts introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available\\\\nfrom only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\\\\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have\\\\nmatured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued\\\\navailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be\\\\naffected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\\\\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\\\ncomponents; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able\\\\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Research and\\\\nDevelopment Because the industries in which the Company competes are\\\\ncharacterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to\\\\ncompete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual\\\\nand timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the\\\\nmarketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance\\\\nexisting products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings\\\\nthrough research and development (“R&D;”), licensing of intellectual property\\\\nand acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual\\\\nProperty The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual\\\\nproperty rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,\\\\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs,\\\\ncopyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the\\\\nU.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the\\\\nownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in\\\\ndifferentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such\\\\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\\\\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly\\\\nfiles patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect\\\\ninnovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and\\\\nis currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time,\\\\nthe Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered\\\\nintellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property\\\\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and\\\\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property\\\\nrights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and\\\\nservices. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the\\\\nCompany’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property\\\\nowned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew\\\\nlicenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and\\\\nservices. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such\\\\nlicenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The\\\\nCompany has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter\\\\ncompared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\\\\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect\\\\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory\\\\nfollowing a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often\\\\ndeclines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be\\\\naffected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\\\nHuman Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated\\\\nteam, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for\\\\nall of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\\\napproximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and\\\\nPolicies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion\\\\nand diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or\\\\ndiscrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that\\\\ncompensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees\\\\nto share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most\\\\nlikely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time\\\\nand support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of\\\\nthis, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the\\\\nworld and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support\\\\nemployees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The\\\\nCompany is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive\\\\nworkforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\\\\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an\\\\ninclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\\\\nemployees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication\\\\namong team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative\\\\nwork environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members\\\\nare encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns,\\\\nand the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like\\\\ncareer development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The\\\\nCompany is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates.\\\\nThe Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures\\\\nto mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general\\\\nsafety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\\\\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.\\\\nAdditionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\\\\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team. Available\\\\nInformation The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\\\\nForm 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed\\\\npursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\\\\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and\\\\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A.\\\\nRisk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors,\\\\nwhether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any\\\\none or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following\\\\nfactors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of\\\\noperations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be\\\\nconsidered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors\\\\nshould not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future\\\\nperiods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\\\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and\\\\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item\\\\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance\\\\ndepend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse\\\\neconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. The Company has international\\\\noperations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the\\\\nCompany’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is\\\\nlarge and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities,\\\\nincluding manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a\\\\nresult, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on\\\\nglobal and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions,\\\\nincluding slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter\\\\ncredit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact\\\\nconsumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for\\\\nthe Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\\\\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal\\\\nand monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\\\nvalues, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand\\\\nfor the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in,\\\\nglobal or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the\\\\nCompany’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\\\\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to\\\\nobtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic\\\\nconditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and\\\\nother financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue\\\\nnew debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s\\\\nfinancial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and\\\\nother international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political\\\\nevents, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural\\\\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\\\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\\\\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\\\ncustomers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales\\\\noutside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and\\\\nthe Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international\\\\ntrade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole\\\\nor in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India,\\\\nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade,\\\\nsuch as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology\\\\nor data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply\\\\nchain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and\\\\nservices to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these\\\\nrestrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives\\\\na significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain\\\\noperations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various\\\\nactions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\\\\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the\\\\nCompany’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on\\\\ninternational trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\\\\nCompany’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no\\\\nadvance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all\\\\nadverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments,\\\\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other\\\\nrestrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and\\\\nconflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response\\\\ncould be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding\\\\ntrade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on\\\\nconsumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical\\\\nbusiness operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are\\\\nin locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\\\\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of\\\\ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other\\\\nindustrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\\\\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including\\\\npandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s\\\\ncontrol. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural\\\\ndisasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more\\\\nfrequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\\\\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its\\\\ncustomers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and\\\\nmanufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s\\\\nservice offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in\\\\naffected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can\\\\nrequire substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to\\\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on\\\\nsingle or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical\\\\ncomponents, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate\\\\nany negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also\\\\nsubject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\\\\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe\\\\nworking environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and\\\\ncould result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues,\\\\nincluding pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected,\\\\nand could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their\\\\nimpact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition\\\\nof protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel\\\\nrestrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products\\\\nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and\\\\nsales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of\\\\ncurrent products and offering of existing services, and delays in production\\\\nramps of new products and development of new services. While the Company\\\\nmaintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Global\\\\nmarkets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and\\\\nsubject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to\\\\ncompete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are\\\\noffered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price\\\\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\\\\nintroduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving\\\\nindustry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance\\\\ncharacteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors,\\\\nand price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s\\\\nability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and\\\\ntimely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to\\\\nthe marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution\\\\nfor its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software\\\\napplications and related services. As a result, the Company must make\\\\nsignificant investments in R&D.; There can be no assurance these investments\\\\nwill achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and\\\\nmarket new products and services successfully. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\\\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and\\\\ncopyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\\\\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek\\\\nto compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\\\\nand by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual\\\\nproperty. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently\\\\navailable in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is\\\\nunable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive\\\\nmargins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the\\\\nCompany’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially\\\\nadversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global\\\\nsmartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces\\\\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant\\\\ntechnical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\\\\nhardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition,\\\\nsome of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced\\\\nproducts and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\\\\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered\\\\nproduct margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\\\\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some\\\\nof the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\\\\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the\\\\nCompany faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s\\\\nproduct features and applications within their products or collaborate to\\\\noffer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The\\\\nCompany also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the\\\\nCompany’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings\\\\nor work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services\\\\nalso face substantial competition, including from companies that have\\\\nsignificant resources and experience and have established service offerings\\\\nwith large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that\\\\nprovide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate\\\\nmeans to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially\\\\non the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to\\\\nmaintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the\\\\nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\\\\neffectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer\\\\ndemand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and\\\\ntransitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and\\\\ncompetitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company\\\\ncompetes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and\\\\ntechnologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate\\\\ncustomer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully\\\\nmanage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The\\\\nsuccess of new product and service introductions depends on a number of\\\\nfactors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the\\\\nCompany’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and\\\\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the\\\\nCompany’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and\\\\ninventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of\\\\nproducts in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated\\\\ndemand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other\\\\ndefects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will\\\\nsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and\\\\nservices. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and\\\\nlogistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\\\\nlocated outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing\\\\nis performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\\\\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a\\\\nsignificant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a\\\\nsmall number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or\\\\nadditions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and\\\\nresources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has\\\\nalso outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While\\\\nthese arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s\\\\ndirect control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has\\\\nfrom time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality\\\\nor quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\\\\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect\\\\nexpense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the\\\\nconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product\\\\ndefects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to\\\\ntime. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code\\\\nof conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time\\\\nand can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\\\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and\\\\nEurope to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners\\\\nprimarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\\\\nCompany’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have\\\\na negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished\\\\ngoods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit\\\\nto final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including\\\\nnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,\\\\ncommercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental,\\\\npublic health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The\\\\nCompany has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held\\\\nat certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of\\\\nits suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these\\\\narrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these\\\\noutsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or\\\\nother disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\\\\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or\\\\nprepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain\\\\ncomponents from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that\\\\nare available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\\\nshortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past\\\\nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the\\\\nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products\\\\non commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in\\\\nthe future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of\\\\nmany components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend\\\\nor renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may\\\\nsuffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for\\\\nthe supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\\\\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s\\\\noperations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\\\\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\\\n” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components Therefore,\\\\nthe Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\\\\nincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. The Company’s new products often utilize\\\\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product\\\\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\\\\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if\\\\nsuppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead\\\\nof components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\\\\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed\\\\nor constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of\\\\ncompleted products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future\\\\ndelays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s\\\\nbusiness and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected\\\\ndepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\\\\nsource, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative\\\\nsource. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time\\\\nby design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company\\\\noffers complex hardware and software products and services that can be\\\\naffected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system\\\\nsoftware and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have\\\\nissues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware\\\\nor software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and\\\\nproducts the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could\\\\nmake the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or\\\\nproperty damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s\\\\nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In\\\\naddition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from\\\\ntime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result,\\\\nfrom time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and\\\\nmay not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will\\\\nbe able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and\\\\nservices it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and\\\\nperformance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition,\\\\nthe Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\\\\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and\\\\nequipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses,\\\\nincluding litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also\\\\nadversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and\\\\nservices, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\\\\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services,\\\\ndelay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 8 The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the\\\\nvalue of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment\\\\ncancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component\\\\ninventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for\\\\nwhich cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary\\\\ncancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The\\\\nCompany reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\\\\nsuppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever\\\\nevents or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the\\\\nCompany determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down\\\\nequal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair\\\\nvalue. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory\\\\nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently\\\\nrecoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs,\\\\nfees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of\\\\nproduct obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The\\\\nCompany orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of\\\\nproduct announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover\\\\nthe Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically\\\\nfor periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile,\\\\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk\\\\nthe Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\\\\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm\\\\npurchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual\\\\nproperty, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms or at all. The Company’s products and services are designed to include\\\\nintellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from\\\\nthose third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the\\\\nindustries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may\\\\ncompete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of\\\\nnew patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe\\\\nexisting patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time,\\\\nthe Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or\\\\nother intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and\\\\nindustry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party\\\\nintellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be\\\\nobtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\\\\nright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual\\\\nproperty on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from\\\\nselling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse\\\\nimpact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from\\\\nthird-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers\\\\nto purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-\\\\nparty software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-\\\\nparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications\\\\nand services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications\\\\nand services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products,\\\\ncustomers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes\\\\nthe availability of third-party software applications and services for its\\\\nproducts depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the\\\\nrelative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such\\\\nas Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and\\\\ntablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This\\\\nanalysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company\\\\nand its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications\\\\nand services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone,\\\\npersonal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to\\\\ndevelop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to\\\\ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’\\\\nproducts with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for\\\\nthe Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued\\\\navailability and development of compelling and innovative software\\\\napplications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems\\\\nare subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are\\\\nunable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\\\\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved\\\\ncustomer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied\\\\ncustomers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 9 The Company distributes third-party applications for its\\\\nproducts through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications,\\\\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company\\\\nretains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services\\\\nor goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has\\\\nmade changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\\\\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The\\\\nCompany expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a\\\\nresult of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the\\\\nEuropean Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to\\\\ncomply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and\\\\ninvestigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to\\\\nthe Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further\\\\nchanges. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers\\\\noutside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future\\\\nchanges could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to\\\\nits platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store,\\\\nand how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers\\\\ninside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could\\\\nreduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those\\\\nsales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains\\\\non such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or\\\\neliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create\\\\ndigital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such\\\\ncontent available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material\\\\nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their\\\\ndigital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer\\\\nsubscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate\\\\nspecific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other\\\\ndistribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time\\\\nperiods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements\\\\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content\\\\nproviders and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing\\\\nproducts and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible\\\\nfor the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other\\\\ncontent owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s\\\\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to\\\\ncontinue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\\\\nwith acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital\\\\ncontent, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\\\\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the\\\\nCompany’s customers. Some third-party digital content providers require the\\\\nCompany to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If\\\\nrequirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology\\\\nto provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able\\\\nto develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely\\\\nmanner. The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of\\\\nits team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled\\\\nemployees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\\\\ndistinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company’s future success\\\\ndepends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\\\\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive\\\\nOfficer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced\\\\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for\\\\ntheir talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the\\\\nCompany’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for\\\\ntalent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\\\\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The\\\\nCompany believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant\\\\ndriver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it\\\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain\\\\nthe highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could\\\\notherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the\\\\nperformance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The\\\\nCompany distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which\\\\ndistribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its\\\\nproducts and services and resells third-party products in most of its major\\\\nmarkets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\\\\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and\\\\nits direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for\\\\nthe Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies\\\\nfor users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will\\\\nbe continued at all or in the same amounts. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\\\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance\\\\nreseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company\\\\nemployees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\\\\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or\\\\nincremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,\\\\nthese resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty\\\\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause\\\\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology\\\\nsystem failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply\\\\nchain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed\\\\nto information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by\\\\nnatural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures,\\\\nacts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins,\\\\nransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions.\\\\nSystem upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective\\\\nor inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and\\\\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such\\\\nfailures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among\\\\nother things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering\\\\nwith customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the\\\\nCompany’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information,\\\\nincluding personal information, could subject the Company to significant\\\\nreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s\\\\nbusiness requires it to use and store confidential information, including\\\\npersonal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees.\\\\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network and data security,\\\\nincluding through the use of encryption and other security measures intended\\\\nto protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute\\\\nsecurity, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\\\\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany’s business also requires it to share confidential information with\\\\nsuppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that\\\\nare also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt\\\\nbusiness operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\\\\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the\\\\nCompany’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\\\\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such\\\\nincidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain\\\\nunauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\\\\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\\\\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other\\\\nthings, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its\\\\nproducts and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\\\\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government\\\\ninvestigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against\\\\nthe Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\\\\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and\\\\ntechniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and\\\\nremove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s\\\\nability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition,\\\\nattacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of\\\\nsevere diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to\\\\ngain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a\\\\nrelatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the\\\\nvalue of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\\\nprocesses. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to\\\\nsecure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to\\\\nor loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access,\\\\nincluding through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As\\\\nwith all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all\\\\neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee\\\\nerror, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\\\\nirregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the\\\\nCompany’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames,\\\\npasswords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for\\\\nunauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To\\\\nhelp protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes\\\\navailable technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services\\\\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious\\\\ncircumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of\\\\ncustomer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and\\\\nservices. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to\\\\naddress certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be\\\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 Investment in new business strategies and\\\\nacquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not\\\\noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies\\\\nor acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and\\\\nuncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\\\\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and\\\\nregulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or\\\\ncountries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and\\\\nintangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition\\\\ntransactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain\\\\nrequired regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition\\\\nof onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing\\\\na transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the\\\\nanticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky\\\\nand may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. The Company’s retail stores are subject to\\\\nnumerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail operations are subject\\\\nto many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\\\nincluding macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general\\\\nretail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs\\\\nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships\\\\nwith existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in\\\\nthe value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail\\\\nlocations at a reasonable cost. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be\\\\nadversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government\\\\ninvestigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings\\\\nand government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of\\\\nbusiness and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in\\\\nthe future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes\\\\ninclude indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and\\\\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number\\\\nof claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the\\\\nCompany, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government\\\\ninvestigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to\\\\nincrease. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of\\\\npatent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may\\\\narise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory\\\\nframeworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\\\\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into\\\\nlitigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of\\\\nintellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\\\\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in\\\\nvarious countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions\\\\nand substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims,\\\\ndefending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\\\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In\\\\nrecognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or\\\\nother arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can\\\\nbe no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\\\nlitigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase\\\\nthe Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\\\\nchange its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain\\\\nproducts and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K\\\\nunder the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\\\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments,\\\\nContingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in\\\\nthe opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently\\\\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or\\\\nan indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above\\\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\\\nFurther, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or\\\\ntrebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\\\\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time\\\\nto time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its\\\\nbusiness practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products\\\\nand services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. While the\\\\nCompany maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such\\\\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\\\\nclaims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject\\\\nto complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the\\\\nCompany to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on\\\\nthe Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex\\\\nand changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy,\\\\ndata security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\\\\nbilling and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability;\\\\nintellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine\\\\nlearning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\\\\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of\\\\nthird-party software applications and services; labor and employment;\\\\nanticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\\\\nrepatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and\\\\ninvestment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic\\\\nwaste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these\\\\nlaws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and\\\\nregulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the\\\\nCompany’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or\\\\nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products\\\\nand services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and\\\\nservices, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its\\\\nbusiness. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty\\\\nabout how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These\\\\nrisks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are\\\\nintroduced into specialized applications, including health and financial\\\\nservices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to\\\\nensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\\\\nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such\\\\nlaws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company\\\\nis found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance\\\\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse\\\\nimpacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing\\\\nregulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the\\\\nCompany has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to\\\\nsatisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies\\\\nand procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a\\\\nviolation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or\\\\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations\\\\nand related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities,\\\\nincreased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s\\\\nbusiness. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and\\\\nother stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and\\\\ngovernance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and\\\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and\\\\ninclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and\\\\ninitiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on\\\\nits website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these\\\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of\\\\nthese goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires\\\\ninvestments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is\\\\noutside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will\\\\nachieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and\\\\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s\\\\ngoals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to\\\\nachieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,\\\\ncomply with federal, state or international environmental, social and\\\\ngovernance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder\\\\nexpectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings\\\\nagainst the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\\\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The\\\\ntechnology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to\\\\nintense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to\\\\nincreasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including\\\\nactions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and\\\\nlegal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further\\\\nbusiness changes in the future, including as a result of legislative\\\\ninitiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which\\\\nthe Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other\\\\njurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers\\\\noutside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future\\\\nchanges could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to\\\\nits platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store,\\\\nand how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers\\\\ninside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 13 The Company is also currently subject to antitrust\\\\ninvestigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in\\\\nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or\\\\nin the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the\\\\nsubject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App\\\\nStore terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings\\\\nagainst the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may\\\\nbe required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the\\\\nApp Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices,\\\\nand may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has\\\\ncommercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that\\\\nare or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved\\\\nagainst those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nFor example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other\\\\ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and\\\\napplications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to\\\\ngovernment investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the\\\\nCompany’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or\\\\nin the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or\\\\nchanges to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s\\\\nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection\\\\nwith other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the\\\\nCompany’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the\\\\nexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in\\\\nharm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\\\\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The\\\\nCompany’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws,\\\\nrules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company\\\\nis subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws\\\\nrelating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various\\\\ntypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to\\\\nthird-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information\\\\namong the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions\\\\nhave passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering\\\\nimposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws\\\\ncontinue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\\\\nComplying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur\\\\nsubstantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company\\\\nto change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant\\\\npenalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and\\\\ndisclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information\\\\nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided\\\\nto customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public\\\\nstatements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\\\\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings\\\\nagainst the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to\\\\nreputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\\\\nsignificant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to\\\\nthe collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information,\\\\nthe Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information\\\\nconsidered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial\\\\ndata and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to\\\\nadditional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the\\\\nCompany is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the\\\\nCompany’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\\\\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or\\\\nfinancial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\\\\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company\\\\ncan be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable\\\\nfor associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or\\\\nfines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under\\\\npayment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially\\\\ncompromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\\\\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow\\\\npayment card industry data security standards. The Company could also\\\\nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose\\\\nthe ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card\\\\nindustry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 Financial Risks The Company expects its\\\\nquarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s\\\\nprofit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and\\\\ndistribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\\\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to\\\\na variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product\\\\npricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to\\\\neffectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services;\\\\ncompressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\\\\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring\\\\nand delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to\\\\nmanage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of\\\\nproducts and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix,\\\\nincluding to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify\\\\nits product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\\\\ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new\\\\nproducts or services, including new products or services with higher cost\\\\nstructures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on\\\\nthe Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has\\\\nhistorically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to\\\\nother quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.\\\\nAdditionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact\\\\nnet sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\\\\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a\\\\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net\\\\nsales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as\\\\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues\\\\nwith new product or service introductions, information technology system\\\\nfailures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics,\\\\ncomponents supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s financial\\\\nperformance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the\\\\nU.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to\\\\nmovements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated\\\\nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the\\\\nCompany’s products in foreign countries and on products that include\\\\ncomponents obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely\\\\naffected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign\\\\nexchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to\\\\nthe U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s\\\\nforeign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the\\\\nCompany to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the\\\\nCompany’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons,\\\\nthe Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S.\\\\ndollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of\\\\nthe gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar,\\\\nwhile generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales\\\\nand earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur\\\\nlosses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the\\\\nbenefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the\\\\nCompany’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus\\\\nadversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments,\\\\nsuch as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\\\\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging\\\\nactivities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the\\\\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates\\\\nover the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to\\\\ncredit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The\\\\nCompany’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity,\\\\ncredit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions,\\\\npolitical risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors.\\\\nAs a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents\\\\nand marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the\\\\nCompany has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents\\\\nand marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K |\\\\n15 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable,\\\\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\\\\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\\\nconditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its\\\\nservices through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\\\\nand resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to\\\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\\\\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade\\\\nreceivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or\\\\nfinancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network\\\\ncarriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\\\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain\\\\ninternational markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\\\\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from\\\\npurchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\\\nmanufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In\\\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply\\\\nagreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023,\\\\nthe Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\\\\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\\\\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is\\\\nsubject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax\\\\nlegislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject\\\\nto taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and\\\\nSingapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to\\\\neconomic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and\\\\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\\\\nchange. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\\\\nDevelopment continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax\\\\nrules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The\\\\nCompany’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\\\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and\\\\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may\\\\nbe uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing\\\\ninterpretations. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax\\\\nreturns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other\\\\ntax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the\\\\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to\\\\ndetermine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance\\\\nas to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates\\\\nwere to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed\\\\nis for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially\\\\nadversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company’s stock is subject\\\\nto volatility. The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price\\\\nvolatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally,\\\\nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have,\\\\nfrom time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations\\\\nthat have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these\\\\ncompanies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price\\\\nat which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the\\\\nstock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its\\\\nstock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The\\\\nCompany also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that\\\\nits cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its\\\\ncurrent share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends\\\\nare subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the\\\\nCompany’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any\\\\nspecific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related\\\\nto future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market\\\\nexpectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly,\\\\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\\\\nretention.

As of September 30, 2023,\\\\nthe Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D;,\\\\ndata centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and\\\\nin various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing\\\\nfacilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in\\\\ngood operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit\\\\nin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\\\\n“District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state\\\\nantitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the\\\\nCompany’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District\\\\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts\\\\nincluded in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of\\\\nthe Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\\\\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\\\\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct\\\\ncustomers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\\\\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App\\\\nStore. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the\\\\n“Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the\\\\nCompany and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further\\\\nreview of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both\\\\npetitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay\\\\nenforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the\\\\nU.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will\\\\nexpire. Masimo Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together,\\\\n“Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission\\\\n(the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to\\\\nthe functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7.\\\\nIn its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting\\\\nimportation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include\\\\nblood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a\\\\nlimited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the\\\\nUnited States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality,\\\\nwhich includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into\\\\neffect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently\\\\nexpected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order\\\\nand seek a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is\\\\nsubject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully\\\\nresolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company\\\\nsettled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not\\\\nindividually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is\\\\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\\\\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period\\\\ncould be materially adversely affected.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also\\\\nutilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which\\\\nwas most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the\\\\nCompany to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may\\\\nbe repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including\\\\nunder plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In August\\\\n2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements\\\\n(“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to\\\\ndeliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in\\\\nexchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of\\\\nshares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average\\\\nrepurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted\\\\naverage price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods,\\\\nwhich end in the first quarter of 2024.

Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or\\\\n53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week\\\\nis included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the\\\\nCompany’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first\\\\nquarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas\\\\nfiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Fiscal Year Highlights The\\\\nCompany’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion\\\\nduring 2023. The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion\\\\nduring 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to\\\\nthe U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in\\\\ntotal net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and\\\\niPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. The Company\\\\nannounces new product, service and software offerings at various times during\\\\nthe year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the\\\\nfollowing: First Quarter 2023: iPad and iPad Pro; Next-generation Apple TV 4K;\\\\nand MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.\\\\nSecond Quarter 2023: MacBook Pro 14”, MacBook Pro 16” and Mac mini; and\\\\nSecond-generation HomePod. Third Quarter 2023: MacBook Air 15”, Mac Studio and\\\\nMac Pro; Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its\\\\nnew visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and iOS\\\\n17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company’s\\\\noperating systems. Fourth Quarter 2023: iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15\\\\nPro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\\\\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90\\\\nbillion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share\\\\nbeginning in May 2023.

Products gross\\\\nmargin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings\\\\nand a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. Services Gross\\\\nMargin Services gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due\\\\nprimarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\\\\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to\\\\nhigher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the\\\\nU.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. The Company’s\\\\nfuture gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in\\\\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a\\\\nresult, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to\\\\nvolatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for\\\\n2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 Change 2022\\\\nChange 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914\\\\nPercentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative\\\\n$ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6\\\\n% Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of\\\\ntotal net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year\\\\ngrowth in R&D; expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-\\\\nrelated expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and\\\\nadministrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income\\\\ntaxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022\\\\nand 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Provision for\\\\nincome taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3\\\\n% Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax\\\\nrate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate\\\\ndue primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of\\\\nthe U.S. federal R&D; credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation,\\\\npartially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for\\\\n2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on\\\\nforeign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued\\\\nby the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax\\\\nbenefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The\\\\nCompany believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted\\\\nmarketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023,\\\\nalong with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt\\\\nmarkets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital\\\\nreturn program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash\\\\nrequirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying\\\\nmaturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively\\\\nthe “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest\\\\npayments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term\\\\npromissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30,\\\\n2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of\\\\nwhich was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements\\\\nfor certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\\\\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\\\nfixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable\\\\nwithin 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes\\\\nseveral outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s\\\\nproducts and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The\\\\nCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide\\\\nvariety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\\\nmanufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are\\\\nprimarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other\\\\npurchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire\\\\ncapital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and\\\\nnoncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed\\\\nintellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September\\\\n30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with\\\\n$5.6 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed\\\\nby the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with\\\\n$6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K\\\\n| 24 Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements,\\\\nthe Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not\\\\nobligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\\\n30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The\\\\nCompany intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to\\\\ndeclaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The\\\\npreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with\\\\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s\\\\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\\\\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates\\\\nthat affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\\\\nPolicies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8\\\\nof this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods\\\\nused in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\\\\nassumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\\\\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\\\\nassets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to\\\\nincome taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of\\\\nthe Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the\\\\ninterpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international\\\\ntax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\\\\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes\\\\nthe Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the\\\\nfinal outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is\\\\nreflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\\\\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\\\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\\\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition\\\\nand operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to\\\\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of\\\\nbusiness, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records\\\\na liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount\\\\nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant\\\\njudgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with\\\\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\\\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The\\\\nCompany is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange\\\\nrates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however,\\\\nthey may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\\\nInterest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S.\\\\ninterest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term\\\\ndebt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the\\\\nCompany’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the\\\\nCompany’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may\\\\nuse derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and\\\\nliabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment\\\\nportfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives,\\\\nthat would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as\\\\nof September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions): Interest\\\\nRate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact\\\\n2023 2022 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair\\\\nvalue $ 3,089 $ 4,022 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in\\\\nannual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company’s\\\\nexposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being\\\\na net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange\\\\nrates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively\\\\naffect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\\\nFluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of\\\\nthe Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\\\\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust\\\\nlocal currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\\\\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of\\\\nreasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company\\\\napplied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative\\\\npositions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\\\\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected\\\\nloss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the\\\\nresults of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\\\\none-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September\\\\n30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s\\\\nunderlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the\\\\nassessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s\\\\nforeign currency derivatives.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and\\\\naccompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management\\\\nestimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial\\\\nstatements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the\\\\ncurrent period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week\\\\nperiod that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the\\\\nCompany’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first\\\\nfiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks,\\\\nwhereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise\\\\nstated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to\\\\nthe Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters,\\\\nmonths and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue The Company records revenue\\\\nnet of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\\\\nauthorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based\\\\ncompensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity\\\\nawards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid\\\\ninvestments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase\\\\nare treated as cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The cost of securities\\\\nsold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories\\\\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant\\\\nand Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a\\\\nstraight-line basis. Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative\\\\nassets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\\\\nSheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and\\\\nliabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings\\\\ncreated by the Act. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and\\\\nnonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data\\\\ncenter and retail facilities. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33 Note 2 –\\\\nRevenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be\\\\nentitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its\\\\ncustomers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present\\\\nright to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership\\\\nof products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the\\\\nCompany’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For\\\\nthe Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are\\\\ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a\\\\nshort period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\\\\nservices, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales\\\\nrelated to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\\\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical\\\\nexperience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which\\\\nrepresent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company\\\\nallocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their\\\\nrelative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses\\\\nobservable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available,\\\\nSSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the\\\\nselling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold\\\\nregularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs\\\\nwithout observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending\\\\nupon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar\\\\nofferings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-\\\\nspecific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance\\\\nobligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations\\\\nregularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and\\\\ncertain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the\\\\nsubstantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled\\\\nsoftware delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is\\\\nthe right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\\\\niCloud , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to\\\\nreceive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software\\\\nupgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\\\\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations\\\\nbased on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for\\\\nthe undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on\\\\nthe Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and\\\\nbundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer,\\\\nwhich generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is\\\\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\\\\nthey are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements,\\\\nthe Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered.\\\\nFor these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the\\\\nundelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled\\\\nconsideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\\\\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose\\\\namounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party\\\\nproducts where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring\\\\nit to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount\\\\nbilled to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining\\\\nwhether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\\\\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible\\\\nproducts or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.\\\\nFor third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not\\\\nobtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\\\\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales\\\\non a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it\\\\nretains. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34 Net sales disaggregated by\\\\nsignificant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in\\\\nmillions): 2023 2022 2021 iPhone (1) $ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 Mac (1)\\\\n29,357 40,177 35,190 iPad (1) 28,300 29,292 31,862 Wearables, Home and\\\\nAccessories (1) 39,845 41,241 38,367 Services (2) 85,200 78,129 68,425 Total\\\\nnet sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 (1) Products net sales include\\\\namortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights,\\\\nwhich are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Services\\\\nnet sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of certain products. Total net sales include $8.2 billion of\\\\nrevenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was\\\\nincluded in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of\\\\nrevenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated\\\\nrevenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note\\\\n13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except\\\\nin Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher\\\\nproportion of net sales.

The Company classifies marketable debt securities\\\\nas either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying\\\\ncontractual maturity date. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may\\\\nuse derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to\\\\nforeign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not\\\\nto hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting\\\\nconsiderations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\\\\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a\\\\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange\\\\nor interest rates. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative\\\\ninstruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\\\nas the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating\\\\nactivities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from\\\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options\\\\nor other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.\\\\nThe Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\\\\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\\\\n12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or\\\\nmarketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company\\\\nmay use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\\\\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is\\\\nhedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\\\\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. The Company may also\\\\nuse derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to\\\\nprotect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as\\\\nwell as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated\\\\nby the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-\\\\nfunctional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt\\\\nor marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\\\\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates\\\\nthese instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional\\\\namounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\\\\n30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022\\\\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 74,730 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125\\\\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 104,777 $ 185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37 The gross fair\\\\nvalues of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24,\\\\n2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated\\\\nas Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting\\\\nHedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts\\\\n$ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1)\\\\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are\\\\nincluded in other current assets and other non-current assets in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using\\\\nLevel 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and\\\\nother non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\\\\nderivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all\\\\ncounterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company\\\\ngenerally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to\\\\nbe received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives\\\\nfluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit\\\\nrisk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the\\\\nrespective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which\\\\nthe Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable\\\\nby one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of\\\\nthese rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts,\\\\nincluding the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative\\\\nassets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net\\\\nderivative asset of $412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged\\\\nitems in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022\\\\nwere as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current\\\\nand non-current marketable securities $ 14,433 $ 13,378 Current and non-\\\\ncurrent term debt $ ( 18,247 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Accounts Receivable Trade\\\\nReceivables As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that\\\\nrepresented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%.\\\\nThe Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44%\\\\nof total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022,\\\\nrespectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 30, 2023,\\\\nthe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of\\\\nwhich $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax\\\\nrate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax\\\\nbenefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would have\\\\nimpacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance\\\\nof gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for\\\\n2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Beginning\\\\nbalances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475 Increases related to tax positions taken\\\\nduring a prior year 2,044 2,284 816 Decreases related to tax positions taken\\\\nduring a prior year ( 1,463 ) ( 1,982 ) ( 1,402 ) Increases related to tax\\\\npositions taken during the current year 2,628 1,936 1,607 Decreases related to\\\\nsettlements with taxing authorities ( 19 ) ( 28 ) ( 1,838 ) Decreases related\\\\nto expiration of the statute of limitations ( 494 ) ( 929 ) ( 181 ) Ending\\\\nbalances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477 The Company is subject to taxation and\\\\nfiles income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and\\\\nforeign jurisd ictions.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41 European\\\\nCommission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission\\\\nannounced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\\\\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of\\\\nprofits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State\\\\nAid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\\\\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through\\\\nDecember 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015,\\\\neliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\\\\nrecovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\\\\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the\\\\nGeneral Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General\\\\nCourt”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.\\\\nOn September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s\\\\ndecision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held\\\\non May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024.\\\\nThe Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit\\\\nfor a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due\\\\nrelated to the State Aid Decision. On an annual basis, the Company may request\\\\napproval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for\\\\ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted\\\\nrecovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery\\\\namount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted\\\\nfrom general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The\\\\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management,\\\\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred\\\\na material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,\\\\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally\\\\navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained\\\\nfrom single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used\\\\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are\\\\nat times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing\\\\nfluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly\\\\nused by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often\\\\nutilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until\\\\nthe suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\\\nCompany’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products\\\\nare manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China\\\\nmainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based\\\\non net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are\\\\ngenerally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s\\\\nretail stores located in those geographic locations.

We also have audited, in accordance with the\\\\nstandards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023\\\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial\\\\nstatements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our\\\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\\\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\\\\nand are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\\\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\\\nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\\\\naudits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\\\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\\\\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\\\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\\\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\\\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\\\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\\\\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\\\\nopinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is\\\\na matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\\\nand that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\\\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\\\nor complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\\\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\\\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\\\\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure\\\\nto which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As\\\\ndiscussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\\\\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\\\\nmany state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total\\\\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5\\\\nbillion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In\\\\naccounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses\\\\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic\\\\nand international tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an\\\\nuncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the\\\\nmeasurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves\\\\nsignificant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal\\\\nrulings. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49 How We Addressed the Matter in Our\\\\nAudit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax\\\\npositions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax\\\\npositions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to\\\\nmeasure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related\\\\ndisclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are\\\\nmore likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among\\\\nothers, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as\\\\napplicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed\\\\nthe basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our\\\\ntax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of\\\\nApple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and\\\\nexperience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\\\\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters\\\\nwith external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated\\\\nApple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the\\\\nfinancial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s\\\\nauditor since 2009. San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023\\\\nForm 10-K | 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the\\\\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal\\\\nControl Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria\\\\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\\\n“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\\\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\\\n30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with\\\\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\\\n30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of\\\\noperations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each\\\\nof the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related\\\\nnotes and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion\\\\nthereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for\\\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple\\\\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\\\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\\\nindependent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\\\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in\\\\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\\\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\\\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\\\\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\\\\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\\\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 2, 2023\\\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with\\\\nAccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and\\\\nProcedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an\\\\nevaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\\\\nofficer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\\\\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were\\\\neffective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files\\\\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\\\\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\\\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\\\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations\\\\nover Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\\\npurposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain\\\\nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\\\\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that\\\\nthe Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with\\\\nauthorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide\\\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a\\\\nmaterial effect on the financial statements. Management, including the\\\\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect\\\\nthat the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all\\\\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\\\\nonly reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\\\\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\\\\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\\\\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\\\\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\\\\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\\\\ndetected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\\\\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become\\\\ninadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of\\\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s\\\\nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s\\\\nmanagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\\\\nExchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\\\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set\\\\nforth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\\\\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\\\\nthe Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\\\\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide\\\\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s\\\\nindependent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued\\\\nan audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting,\\\\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal\\\\nControl over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s\\\\ninternal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023,\\\\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by\\\\nparagraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have\\\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\\\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.

Form 10-K Summary 57 This Annual\\\\nReport on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements, within\\\\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that\\\\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking statements are\\\\nlocated in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Business” and\\\\nPart II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion\\\\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Forward-\\\\nlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\\\\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to\\\\nany historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K\\\\nregarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the\\\\nCompany’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.\\\\nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,”\\\\n“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,”\\\\n“predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms.\\\\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the\\\\nCompany’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed\\\\nin the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences\\\\ninclude, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this\\\\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation\\\\nto revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as\\\\nrequired by law.

Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers\\\\ncollectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise\\\\nstated. PART I Item 1.

AppleCare The Company offers a portfolio of fee-based\\\\nservice and support products under the AppleCare brand. The offerings provide\\\\npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple\\\\nauthorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many\\\\ncases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and\\\\nloss, depending on the country and type of product. Cloud Services The\\\\nCompany’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and\\\\navailable across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\\\\nDigital Content The Company operates various platforms, including the App\\\\nStore that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital\\\\ncontent, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.

Payment Services The Company offers payment services,\\\\nincluding Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless\\\\npayment service. Segments The Company manages its business primarily on a\\\\ngeographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,\\\\nEurope, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both\\\\nNorth and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India,\\\\nthe Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries\\\\nnot included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the\\\\nreportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar\\\\nservices, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of\\\\nthe Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market\\\\ndynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company’s\\\\ncustomers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business,\\\\neducation, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products\\\\nand resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to\\\\ncustomers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The\\\\nCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as\\\\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.\\\\nDuring 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect\\\\ndistribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net\\\\nsales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are\\\\nhighly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and\\\\nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new\\\\nproducts and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\\\\ncontinual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\\\\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity\\\\non the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors\\\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost\\\\nstructures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\\\nintellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 The Company’s ability\\\\nto compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely\\\\nintroduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the\\\\nmarketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software\\\\napplications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to\\\\nthe Company include price, product and service features (including security\\\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\\\\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories\\\\necosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and\\\\ncorporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market\\\\nopportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\\\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in\\\\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software,\\\\nand service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the\\\\nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a\\\\nlarger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly\\\\nintense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures\\\\nto provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s\\\\nservices compete with business models that provide content to users for free\\\\nand use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\\\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate\\\\nthe Company’s product features and applications within their products, or\\\\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those\\\\nthey currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential\\\\nto the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources,\\\\ncertain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The\\\\nCompany also competes for various components with other participants in the\\\\nmarkets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and\\\\naccessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those\\\\nthat are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-\\\\nwide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses\\\\nsome custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new\\\\nproducts introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available\\\\nfrom only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\\\\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have\\\\nmatured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued\\\\navailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be\\\\naffected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\\\\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\\\ncomponents; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able\\\\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Research and\\\\nDevelopment Because the industries in which the Company competes are\\\\ncharacterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to\\\\ncompete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual\\\\nand timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the\\\\nmarketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance\\\\nexisting products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings\\\\nthrough research and development (“R&D;”), licensing of intellectual property\\\\nand acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual\\\\nProperty The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual\\\\nproperty rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,\\\\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs,\\\\ncopyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the\\\\nU.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the\\\\nownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in\\\\ndifferentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such\\\\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\\\\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly\\\\nfiles patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect\\\\ninnovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and\\\\nis currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time,\\\\nthe Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered\\\\nintellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property\\\\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and\\\\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property\\\\nrights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and\\\\nservices. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the\\\\nCompany’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property\\\\nowned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew\\\\nlicenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and\\\\nservices. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such\\\\nlicenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The\\\\nCompany has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter\\\\ncompared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\\\\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect\\\\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory\\\\nfollowing a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often\\\\ndeclines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be\\\\naffected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\\\nHuman Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated\\\\nteam, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for\\\\nall of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\\\napproximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and\\\\nPolicies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion\\\\nand diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or\\\\ndiscrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that\\\\ncompensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees\\\\nto share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most\\\\nlikely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time\\\\nand support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of\\\\nthis, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the\\\\nworld and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support\\\\nemployees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The\\\\nCompany is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive\\\\nworkforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\\\\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an\\\\ninclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\\\\nemployees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication\\\\namong team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative\\\\nwork environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members\\\\nare encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns,\\\\nand the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like\\\\ncareer development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The\\\\nCompany is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates.\\\\nThe Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures\\\\nto mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general\\\\nsafety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\\\\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.\\\\nAdditionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\\\\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A.\\\\nRisk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors,\\\\nwhether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any\\\\none or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following\\\\nfactors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of\\\\noperations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be\\\\nconsidered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors\\\\nshould not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future\\\\nperiods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\\\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and\\\\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item\\\\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance\\\\ndepend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse\\\\neconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. The Company has international\\\\noperations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the\\\\nCompany’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is\\\\nlarge and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities,\\\\nincluding manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a\\\\nresult, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on\\\\nglobal and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions,\\\\nincluding slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter\\\\ncredit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact\\\\nconsumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for\\\\nthe Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\\\\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal\\\\nand monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\\\nvalues, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand\\\\nfor the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in,\\\\nglobal or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the\\\\nCompany’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\\\\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to\\\\nobtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic\\\\nconditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and\\\\nother financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue\\\\nnew debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s\\\\nfinancial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and\\\\nother international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political\\\\nevents, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural\\\\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\\\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global\\\\neconomy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\\\ncustomers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales\\\\noutside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and\\\\nthe Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international\\\\ntrade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole\\\\nor in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India,\\\\nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade,\\\\nsuch as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology\\\\nor data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply\\\\nchain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and\\\\nservices to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these\\\\nrestrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives\\\\na significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain\\\\noperations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various\\\\nactions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\\\\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the\\\\nCompany’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on\\\\ninternational trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\\\\nCompany’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no\\\\nadvance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all\\\\nadverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments,\\\\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other\\\\nrestrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and\\\\nconflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response\\\\ncould be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding\\\\ntrade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on\\\\nconsumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical\\\\nbusiness operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are\\\\nin locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\\\\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of\\\\ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other\\\\nindustrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\\\\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including\\\\npandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s\\\\ncontrol. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural\\\\ndisasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more\\\\nfrequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or\\\\nimpossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its\\\\ncustomers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and\\\\nmanufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s\\\\nservice offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in\\\\naffected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can\\\\nrequire substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to\\\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on\\\\nsingle or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical\\\\ncomponents, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate\\\\nany negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also\\\\nsubject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\\\\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe\\\\nworking environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and\\\\ncould result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues,\\\\nincluding pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected,\\\\nand could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their\\\\nimpact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition\\\\nof protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel\\\\nrestrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products\\\\nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and\\\\nsales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of\\\\ncurrent products and offering of existing services, and delays in production\\\\nramps of new products and development of new services. While the Company\\\\nmaintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Global\\\\nmarkets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and\\\\nsubject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to\\\\ncompete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are\\\\noffered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price\\\\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\\\\nintroduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving\\\\nindustry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance\\\\ncharacteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors,\\\\nand price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s\\\\nability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and\\\\ntimely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to\\\\nthe marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution\\\\nfor its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software\\\\napplications and related services. As a result, the Company must make\\\\nsignificant investments in R&D.; There can be no assurance these investments\\\\nwill achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and\\\\nmarket new products and services successfully. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\\\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and\\\\ncopyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\\\\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek\\\\nto compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\\\\nand by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual\\\\nproperty. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently\\\\navailable in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is\\\\nunable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive\\\\nmargins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the\\\\nCompany’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially\\\\nadversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global\\\\nsmartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces\\\\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant\\\\ntechnical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\\\\nhardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition,\\\\nsome of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced\\\\nproducts and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\\\\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered\\\\nproduct margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\\\\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some\\\\nof the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\\\\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the\\\\nCompany faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s\\\\nproduct features and applications within their products or collaborate to\\\\noffer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The\\\\nCompany also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the\\\\nCompany’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings\\\\nor work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services\\\\nalso face substantial competition, including from companies that have\\\\nsignificant resources and experience and have established service offerings\\\\nwith large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that\\\\nprovide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate\\\\nmeans to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially\\\\non the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to\\\\nmaintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the\\\\nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\\\\neffectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer\\\\ndemand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and\\\\ntransitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and\\\\ncompetitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company\\\\ncompetes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and\\\\ntechnologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate\\\\ncustomer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully\\\\nmanage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The\\\\nsuccess of new product and service introductions depends on a number of\\\\nfactors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the\\\\nCompany’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and\\\\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the\\\\nCompany’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and\\\\ninventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of\\\\nproducts in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated\\\\ndemand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other\\\\ndefects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will\\\\nsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and\\\\nservices. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and\\\\nlogistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\\\\nlocated outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing\\\\nis performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\\\\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a\\\\nsignificant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a\\\\nsmall number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or\\\\nadditions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and\\\\nresources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has\\\\nalso outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While\\\\nthese arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s\\\\ndirect control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has\\\\nfrom time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality\\\\nor quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\\\\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect\\\\nexpense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the\\\\nconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product\\\\ndefects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to\\\\ntime. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code\\\\nof conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time\\\\nand can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\\\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and\\\\nEurope to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners\\\\nprimarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\\\\nCompany’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have\\\\na negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished\\\\ngoods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit\\\\nto final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including\\\\nnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,\\\\ncommercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental,\\\\npublic health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The\\\\nCompany has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held\\\\nat certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of\\\\nits suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these\\\\narrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these\\\\noutsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or\\\\nother disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\\\\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or\\\\nprepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain\\\\ncomponents from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that\\\\nare available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\\\nshortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past\\\\nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the\\\\nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products\\\\non commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in\\\\nthe future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of\\\\nmany components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend\\\\nor renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may\\\\nsuffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for\\\\nthe supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\\\\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s\\\\noperations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\\\\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\\\n” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components Therefore,\\\\nthe Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\\\\nincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. The Company’s new products often utilize\\\\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product\\\\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\\\\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if\\\\nsuppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead\\\\nof components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the\\\\nCompany’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed\\\\nor constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of\\\\ncompleted products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future\\\\ndelays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s\\\\nbusiness and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected\\\\ndepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\\\\nsource, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative\\\\nsource. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time\\\\nby design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company\\\\noffers complex hardware and software products and services that can be\\\\naffected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system\\\\nsoftware and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have\\\\nissues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware\\\\nor software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and\\\\nproducts the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could\\\\nmake the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or\\\\nproperty damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s\\\\nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In\\\\naddition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from\\\\ntime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result,\\\\nfrom time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and\\\\nmay not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will\\\\nbe able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and\\\\nservices it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and\\\\nperformance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition,\\\\nthe Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\\\\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and\\\\nequipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses,\\\\nincluding litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also\\\\nadversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and\\\\nservices, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\\\\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services,\\\\ndelay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 8 The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the\\\\nvalue of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment\\\\ncancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component\\\\ninventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for\\\\nwhich cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary\\\\ncancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The\\\\nCompany reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\\\\nsuppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever\\\\nevents or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the\\\\nCompany determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down\\\\nequal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair\\\\nvalue. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory\\\\nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently\\\\nrecoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs,\\\\nfees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of\\\\nproduct obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The\\\\nCompany orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of\\\\nproduct announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover\\\\nthe Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically\\\\nfor periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile,\\\\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk\\\\nthe Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\\\\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm\\\\npurchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual\\\\nproperty, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms or at all. The Company’s products and services are designed to include\\\\nintellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from\\\\nthose third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the\\\\nindustries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may\\\\ncompete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of\\\\nnew patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe\\\\nexisting patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time,\\\\nthe Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or\\\\nother intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and\\\\nindustry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party\\\\nintellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be\\\\nobtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\\\\nright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual\\\\nproperty on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from\\\\nselling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse\\\\nimpact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from\\\\nthird-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers\\\\nto purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-\\\\nparty software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-\\\\nparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications\\\\nand services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications\\\\nand services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products,\\\\ncustomers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes\\\\nthe availability of third-party software applications and services for its\\\\nproducts depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the\\\\nrelative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such\\\\nas Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and\\\\ntablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This\\\\nanalysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company\\\\nand its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications\\\\nand services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone,\\\\npersonal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to\\\\ndevelop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to\\\\ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’\\\\nproducts with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for\\\\nthe Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued\\\\navailability and development of compelling and innovative software\\\\napplications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems\\\\nare subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are\\\\nunable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\\\\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved\\\\ncustomer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied\\\\ncustomers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 9 The Company distributes third-party applications for its\\\\nproducts through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications,\\\\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company\\\\nretains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services\\\\nor goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has\\\\nmade changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\\\\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The\\\\nCompany expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a\\\\nresult of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the\\\\nEuropean Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to\\\\ncomply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and\\\\ninvestigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to\\\\nthe Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further\\\\nchanges. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers\\\\noutside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future\\\\nchanges could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to\\\\nits platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store,\\\\nand how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers\\\\ninside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could\\\\nreduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those\\\\nsales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains\\\\non such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or\\\\neliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create\\\\ndigital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such\\\\ncontent available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material\\\\nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their\\\\ndigital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer\\\\nsubscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate\\\\nspecific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other\\\\ndistribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time\\\\nperiods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements\\\\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content\\\\nproviders and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing\\\\nproducts and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible\\\\nfor the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other\\\\ncontent owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s\\\\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to\\\\ncontinue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\\\\nwith acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital\\\\ncontent, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\\\\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the\\\\nCompany’s customers. Some third-party digital content providers require the\\\\nCompany to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If\\\\nrequirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology\\\\nto provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able\\\\nto develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely\\\\nmanner. The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of\\\\nits team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled\\\\nemployees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its\\\\ndistinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company’s future success\\\\ndepends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\\\\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive\\\\nOfficer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced\\\\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for\\\\ntheir talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the\\\\nCompany’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for\\\\ntalent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not\\\\nmanage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The\\\\nCompany believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant\\\\ndriver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it\\\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain\\\\nthe highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could\\\\notherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the\\\\nperformance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The\\\\nCompany distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which\\\\ndistribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its\\\\nproducts and services and resells third-party products in most of its major\\\\nmarkets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\\\\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and\\\\nits direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for\\\\nthe Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies\\\\nfor users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will\\\\nbe continued at all or in the same amounts. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\\\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance\\\\nreseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company\\\\nemployees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These\\\\nprograms can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or\\\\nincremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,\\\\nthese resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty\\\\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause\\\\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology\\\\nsystem failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply\\\\nchain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed\\\\nto information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by\\\\nnatural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures,\\\\nacts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins,\\\\nransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions.\\\\nSystem upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective\\\\nor inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and\\\\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such\\\\nfailures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among\\\\nother things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering\\\\nwith customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the\\\\nCompany’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information,\\\\nincluding personal information, could subject the Company to significant\\\\nreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s\\\\nbusiness requires it to use and store confidential information, including\\\\npersonal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees.\\\\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network and data security,\\\\nincluding through the use of encryption and other security measures intended\\\\nto protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute\\\\nsecurity, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\\\\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany’s business also requires it to share confidential information with\\\\nsuppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that\\\\nare also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt\\\\nbusiness operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\\\\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the\\\\nCompany’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\\\\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such\\\\nincidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain\\\\nunauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\\\\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential\\\\ninformation or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other\\\\nthings, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its\\\\nproducts and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage\\\\ncommercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government\\\\ninvestigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against\\\\nthe Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\\\\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and\\\\ntechniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and\\\\nremove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s\\\\nability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition,\\\\nattacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of\\\\nsevere diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to\\\\ngain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a\\\\nrelatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the\\\\nvalue of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\\\nprocesses. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to\\\\nsecure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to\\\\nor loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access,\\\\nincluding through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As\\\\nwith all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all\\\\neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee\\\\nerror, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\\\\nirregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the\\\\nCompany’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames,\\\\npasswords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for\\\\nunauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To\\\\nhelp protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes\\\\navailable technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services\\\\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious\\\\ncircumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of\\\\ncustomer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and\\\\nservices. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to\\\\naddress certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be\\\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 Investment in new business strategies and\\\\nacquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not\\\\noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies\\\\nor acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and\\\\nuncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\\\\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and\\\\nregulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or\\\\ncountries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and\\\\nintangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition\\\\ntransactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain\\\\nrequired regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition\\\\nof onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing\\\\na transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the\\\\nanticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky\\\\nand may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. The Company’s retail stores are subject to\\\\nnumerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail operations are subject\\\\nto many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\\\nincluding macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general\\\\nretail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs\\\\nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships\\\\nwith existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in\\\\nthe value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail\\\\nlocations at a reasonable cost. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be\\\\nadversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government\\\\ninvestigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings\\\\nand government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of\\\\nbusiness and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in\\\\nthe future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes\\\\ninclude indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and\\\\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number\\\\nof claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the\\\\nCompany, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government\\\\ninvestigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to\\\\nincrease. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of\\\\npatent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may\\\\narise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory\\\\nframeworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies\\\\nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into\\\\nlitigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of\\\\nintellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement\\\\nactions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in\\\\nvarious countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions\\\\nand substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims,\\\\ndefending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\\\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In\\\\nrecognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or\\\\nother arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can\\\\nbe no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\\\nlitigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase\\\\nthe Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\\\\nchange its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain\\\\nproducts and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K\\\\nunder the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\\\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments,\\\\nContingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in\\\\nthe opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently\\\\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or\\\\nan indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above\\\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\\\nFurther, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or\\\\ntrebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\\\\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time\\\\nto time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its\\\\nbusiness practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products\\\\nand services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. While the\\\\nCompany maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such\\\\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\\\\nclaims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject\\\\nto complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the\\\\nCompany to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on\\\\nthe Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex\\\\nand changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy,\\\\ndata security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\\\\nbilling and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability;\\\\nintellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine\\\\nlearning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\\\\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of\\\\nthird-party software applications and services; labor and employment;\\\\nanticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\\\\nrepatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and\\\\ninvestment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic\\\\nwaste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these\\\\nlaws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and\\\\nregulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the\\\\nCompany’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or\\\\nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products\\\\nand services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and\\\\nservices, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its\\\\nbusiness. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty\\\\nabout how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These\\\\nrisks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are\\\\nintroduced into specialized applications, including health and financial\\\\nservices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to\\\\nensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\\\\nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such\\\\nlaws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company\\\\nis found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance\\\\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse\\\\nimpacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing\\\\nregulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the\\\\nCompany has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to\\\\nsatisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies\\\\nand procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a\\\\nviolation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or\\\\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations\\\\nand related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities,\\\\nincreased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s\\\\nbusiness. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and\\\\nother stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and\\\\ngovernance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and\\\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and\\\\ninclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and\\\\ninitiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on\\\\nits website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these\\\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of\\\\nthese goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires\\\\ninvestments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is\\\\noutside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will\\\\nachieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and\\\\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s\\\\ngoals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to\\\\nachieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,\\\\ncomply with federal, state or international environmental, social and\\\\ngovernance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder\\\\nexpectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings\\\\nagainst the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\\\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The\\\\ntechnology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to\\\\nintense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to\\\\nincreasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including\\\\nactions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and\\\\nlegal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further\\\\nbusiness changes in the future, including as a result of legislative\\\\ninitiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which\\\\nthe Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other\\\\njurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers\\\\noutside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future\\\\nchanges could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to\\\\nits platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store,\\\\nand how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers\\\\ninside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 13 The Company is also currently subject to antitrust\\\\ninvestigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in\\\\nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or\\\\nin the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the\\\\nsubject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App\\\\nStore terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings\\\\nagainst the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may\\\\nbe required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the\\\\nApp Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices,\\\\nand may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has\\\\ncommercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that\\\\nare or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved\\\\nagainst those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nFor example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other\\\\ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and\\\\napplications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to\\\\ngovernment investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the\\\\nCompany’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or\\\\nin the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or\\\\nchanges to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s\\\\nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection\\\\nwith other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the\\\\nCompany’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the\\\\nexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in\\\\nharm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\\\\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The\\\\nCompany’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws,\\\\nrules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company\\\\nis subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws\\\\nrelating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various\\\\ntypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to\\\\nthird-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information\\\\namong the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions\\\\nhave passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering\\\\nimposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws\\\\ncontinue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\\\\nComplying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur\\\\nsubstantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company\\\\nto change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant\\\\npenalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and\\\\ndisclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information\\\\nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided\\\\nto customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public\\\\nstatements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\\\\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings\\\\nagainst the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to\\\\nreputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\\\\nsignificant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to\\\\nthe collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information,\\\\nthe Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information\\\\nconsidered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial\\\\ndata and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to\\\\nadditional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the\\\\nCompany is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the\\\\nCompany’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\\\\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or\\\\nfinancial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\\\\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company\\\\ncan be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable\\\\nfor associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or\\\\nfines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under\\\\npayment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially\\\\ncompromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\\\\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow\\\\npayment card industry data security standards. The Company could also\\\\nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose\\\\nthe ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card\\\\nindustry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 Financial Risks The Company expects its\\\\nquarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s\\\\nprofit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and\\\\ndistribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\\\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to\\\\na variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product\\\\npricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to\\\\neffectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services;\\\\ncompressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\\\\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring\\\\nand delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to\\\\nmanage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of\\\\nproducts and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix,\\\\nincluding to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify\\\\nits product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\\\\ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new\\\\nproducts or services, including new products or services with higher cost\\\\nstructures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on\\\\nthe Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has\\\\nhistorically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to\\\\nother quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.\\\\nAdditionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact\\\\nnet sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\\\\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a\\\\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net\\\\nsales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as\\\\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues\\\\nwith new product or service introductions, information technology system\\\\nfailures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics,\\\\ncomponents supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s financial\\\\nperformance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the\\\\nU.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to\\\\nmovements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated\\\\nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the\\\\nCompany’s products in foreign countries and on products that include\\\\ncomponents obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely\\\\naffected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign\\\\nexchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to\\\\nthe U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s\\\\nforeign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the\\\\nCompany to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the\\\\nCompany’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons,\\\\nthe Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S.\\\\ndollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of\\\\nthe gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar,\\\\nwhile generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales\\\\nand earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur\\\\nlosses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the\\\\nbenefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the\\\\nCompany’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus\\\\nadversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments,\\\\nsuch as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\\\\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging\\\\nactivities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the\\\\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates\\\\nover the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to\\\\ncredit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The\\\\nCompany’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity,\\\\ncredit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions,\\\\npolitical risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors.\\\\nAs a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents\\\\nand marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the\\\\nCompany has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents\\\\nand marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K |\\\\n15 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable,\\\\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\\\\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\\\nconditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its\\\\nservices through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\\\\nand resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to\\\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\\\\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade\\\\nreceivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or\\\\nfinancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network\\\\ncarriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\\\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain\\\\ninternational markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\\\\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from\\\\npurchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\\\nmanufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In\\\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply\\\\nagreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023,\\\\nthe Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\\\\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\\\\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is\\\\nsubject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax\\\\nlegislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject\\\\nto taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and\\\\nSingapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to\\\\neconomic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and\\\\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\\\\nchange. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\\\\nDevelopment continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax\\\\nrules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The\\\\nCompany’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\\\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and\\\\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may\\\\nbe uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing\\\\ninterpretations. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax\\\\nreturns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other\\\\ntax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the\\\\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to\\\\ndetermine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance\\\\nas to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates\\\\nwere to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed\\\\nis for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially\\\\nadversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company’s stock is subject\\\\nto volatility. The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price\\\\nvolatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally,\\\\nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have,\\\\nfrom time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations\\\\nthat have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these\\\\ncompanies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price\\\\nat which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the\\\\nstock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its\\\\nstock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The\\\\nCompany also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that\\\\nits cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its\\\\ncurrent share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends\\\\nare subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the\\\\nCompany’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any\\\\nspecific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related\\\\nto future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market\\\\nexpectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly,\\\\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\\\\nretention.

As of September 30, 2023,\\\\nthe Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D;,\\\\ndata centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and\\\\nin various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing\\\\nfacilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in\\\\ngood operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit\\\\nin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the\\\\n“District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state\\\\nantitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the\\\\nCompany’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District\\\\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts\\\\nincluded in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of\\\\nthe Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair\\\\ncompetition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\\\\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct\\\\ncustomers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\\\\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App\\\\nStore. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the\\\\n“Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the\\\\nCompany and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further\\\\nreview of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both\\\\npetitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay\\\\nenforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the\\\\nU.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will\\\\nexpire. Masimo Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together,\\\\n“Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission\\\\n(the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to\\\\nthe functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7.\\\\nIn its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting\\\\nimportation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include\\\\nblood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a\\\\nlimited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the\\\\nUnited States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality,\\\\nwhich includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into\\\\neffect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently\\\\nexpected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order\\\\nand seek a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is\\\\nsubject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully\\\\nresolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company\\\\nsettled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not\\\\nindividually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is\\\\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\\\\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period\\\\ncould be materially adversely affected.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also\\\\nutilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which\\\\nwas most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the\\\\nCompany to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may\\\\nbe repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including\\\\nunder plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In August\\\\n2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements\\\\n(“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to\\\\ndeliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in\\\\nexchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of\\\\nshares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average\\\\nrepurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted\\\\naverage price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods,\\\\nwhich end in the first quarter of 2024.

The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion\\\\nduring 2023 compared to 2022.

Europe Europe net sales\\\\ndecreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the\\\\nentire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily\\\\nof lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially\\\\noffset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. Greater China Greater China\\\\nnet sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The\\\\nweakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than\\\\nthe entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted\\\\nprimarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. Japan Japan net sales\\\\ndecreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

Apple Inc. |\\\\n2023 Form 10-K | 21 Products and Services Performance The following table\\\\nshows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions):\\\\n2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 200,583 (2) %\\\\n$ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) 29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1)\\\\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) 39,845\\\\n(3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) 85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net\\\\nsales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 (1) Products net sales include\\\\namortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights,\\\\nwhich are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Services\\\\nnet sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased 2% or\\\\n$4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro\\\\niPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. Mac\\\\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due\\\\nprimarily to lower net sales of laptops. iPad iPad net sales decreased 3% or\\\\n$1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of\\\\niPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th\\\\nand 10th generation. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and\\\\nAccessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to\\\\n2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. Services\\\\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022\\\\ndue to higher net sales across all lines of business. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form\\\\n10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin\\\\npercentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023\\\\n2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345\\\\n56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 Gross margin\\\\npercentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total\\\\ngross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % Products Gross Margin Products\\\\ngross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume,\\\\npartially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. Products gross\\\\nmargin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings\\\\nand a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. Services Gross\\\\nMargin Services gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due\\\\nprimarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\\\\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to\\\\nhigher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the\\\\nU.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. The Company’s\\\\nfuture gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in\\\\nPart I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a\\\\nresult, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to\\\\nvolatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for\\\\n2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 Change 2022\\\\nChange 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914\\\\nPercentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative\\\\n$ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6\\\\n% Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of\\\\ntotal net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year\\\\ngrowth in R&D; expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-\\\\nrelated expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and\\\\nadministrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income\\\\ntaxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022\\\\nand 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Provision for\\\\nincome taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3\\\\n% Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax\\\\nrate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate\\\\ndue primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of\\\\nthe U.S. federal R&D; credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation,\\\\npartially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for\\\\n2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on\\\\nforeign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued\\\\nby the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax\\\\nbenefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The\\\\nCompany believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted\\\\nmarketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023,\\\\nalong with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt\\\\nmarkets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital\\\\nreturn program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash\\\\nrequirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying\\\\nmaturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively\\\\nthe “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest\\\\npayments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term\\\\npromissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30,\\\\n2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of\\\\nwhich was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements\\\\nfor certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\\\\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\\\nfixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable\\\\nwithin 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes\\\\nseveral outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s\\\\nproducts and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The\\\\nCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide\\\\nvariety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had\\\\nmanufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are\\\\nprimarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other\\\\npurchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire\\\\ncapital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and\\\\nnoncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed\\\\nintellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September\\\\n30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with\\\\n$5.6 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed\\\\nby the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with\\\\n$6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K\\\\n| 24 Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements,\\\\nthe Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not\\\\nobligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\\\n30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The\\\\nCompany intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to\\\\ndeclaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The\\\\npreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with\\\\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s\\\\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\\\\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates\\\\nthat affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\\\\nPolicies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8\\\\nof this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods\\\\nused in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\\\\nassumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\\\\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\\\\nassets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to\\\\nincome taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of\\\\nthe Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the\\\\ninterpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international\\\\ntax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\\\\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes\\\\nthe Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the\\\\nfinal outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is\\\\nreflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\\\\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\\\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\\\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition\\\\nand operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to\\\\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of\\\\nbusiness, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records\\\\na liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount\\\\nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant\\\\njudgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with\\\\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\\\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The\\\\nCompany is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange\\\\nrates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however,\\\\nthey may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\\\nInterest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S.\\\\ninterest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term\\\\ndebt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the\\\\nCompany’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the\\\\nCompany’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may\\\\nuse derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and\\\\nliabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment\\\\nportfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives,\\\\nthat would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as\\\\nof September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions): Interest\\\\nRate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact\\\\n2023 2022 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair\\\\nvalue $ 3,089 $ 4,022 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in\\\\nannual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company’s\\\\nexposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being\\\\na net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange\\\\nrates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively\\\\naffect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\\\nFluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of\\\\nthe Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\\\\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust\\\\nlocal currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\\\\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of\\\\nreasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company\\\\napplied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative\\\\npositions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\\\\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected\\\\nloss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the\\\\nresults of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\\\\none-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September\\\\n30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s\\\\nunderlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the\\\\nassessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s\\\\nforeign currency derivatives.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and\\\\naccompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management\\\\nestimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial\\\\nstatements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the\\\\ncurrent period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week\\\\nperiod that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the\\\\nCompany’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first\\\\nfiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks,\\\\nwhereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise\\\\nstated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to\\\\nthe Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters,\\\\nmonths and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue The Company records revenue\\\\nnet of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental\\\\nauthorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based\\\\ncompensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity\\\\nawards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid\\\\ninvestments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase\\\\nare treated as cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The cost of securities\\\\nsold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories\\\\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant\\\\nand Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a\\\\nstraight-line basis. Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative\\\\nassets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance\\\\nSheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and\\\\nliabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings\\\\ncreated by the Act. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and\\\\nnonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data\\\\ncenter and retail facilities. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33 Note 2 –\\\\nRevenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be\\\\nentitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its\\\\ncustomers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present\\\\nright to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership\\\\nof products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the\\\\nCompany’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For\\\\nthe Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are\\\\ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a\\\\nshort period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\\\\nservices, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales\\\\nrelated to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\\\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical\\\\nexperience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which\\\\nrepresent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company\\\\nallocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their\\\\nrelative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses\\\\nobservable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available,\\\\nSSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the\\\\nselling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold\\\\nregularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs\\\\nwithout observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending\\\\nupon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar\\\\nofferings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-\\\\nspecific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance\\\\nobligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations\\\\nregularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and\\\\ncertain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the\\\\nsubstantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled\\\\nsoftware delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is\\\\nthe right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\\\\niCloud , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to\\\\nreceive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software\\\\nupgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\\\\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations\\\\nbased on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for\\\\nthe undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on\\\\nthe Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and\\\\nbundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer,\\\\nwhich generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is\\\\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\\\\nthey are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements,\\\\nthe Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered.\\\\nFor these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the\\\\nundelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled\\\\nconsideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\\\\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose\\\\namounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party\\\\nproducts where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring\\\\nit to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount\\\\nbilled to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining\\\\nwhether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\\\\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible\\\\nproducts or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.\\\\nFor third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not\\\\nobtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\\\\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales\\\\non a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it\\\\nretains. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34 Net sales disaggregated by\\\\nsignificant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in\\\\nmillions): 2023 2022 2021 iPhone (1) $ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 Mac (1)\\\\n29,357 40,177 35,190 iPad (1) 28,300 29,292 31,862 Wearables, Home and\\\\nAccessories (1) 39,845 41,241 38,367 Services (2) 85,200 78,129 68,425 Total\\\\nnet sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 (1) Products net sales include\\\\namortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights,\\\\nwhich are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Services\\\\nnet sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of certain products. Total net sales include $8.2 billion of\\\\nrevenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was\\\\nincluded in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of\\\\nrevenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated\\\\nrevenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note\\\\n13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except\\\\nin Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher\\\\nproportion of net sales.

The Company classifies marketable debt securities\\\\nas either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying\\\\ncontractual maturity date. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may\\\\nuse derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to\\\\nforeign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not\\\\nto hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting\\\\nconsiderations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\\\\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a\\\\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange\\\\nor interest rates. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative\\\\ninstruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\\\nas the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating\\\\nactivities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from\\\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options\\\\nor other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.\\\\nThe Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\\\\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\\\\n12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or\\\\nmarketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company\\\\nmay use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\\\\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is\\\\nhedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\\\\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. The Company may also\\\\nuse derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to\\\\nprotect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as\\\\nwell as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated\\\\nby the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-\\\\nfunctional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt\\\\nor marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\\\\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates\\\\nthese instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional\\\\namounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\\\\n30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022\\\\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 74,730 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125\\\\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 104,777 $ 185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37 The gross fair\\\\nvalues of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24,\\\\n2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated\\\\nas Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting\\\\nHedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts\\\\n$ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1)\\\\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are\\\\nincluded in other current assets and other non-current assets in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using\\\\nLevel 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and\\\\nother non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\\\\nderivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all\\\\ncounterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company\\\\ngenerally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to\\\\nbe received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives\\\\nfluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit\\\\nrisk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the\\\\nrespective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which\\\\nthe Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable\\\\nby one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of\\\\nthese rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts,\\\\nincluding the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative\\\\nassets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net\\\\nderivative asset of $412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged\\\\nitems in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022\\\\nwere as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current\\\\nand non-current marketable securities $ 14,433 $ 13,378 Current and non-\\\\ncurrent term debt $ ( 18,247 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Accounts Receivable Trade\\\\nReceivables As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that\\\\nrepresented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%.\\\\nThe Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44%\\\\nof total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022,\\\\nrespectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 30, 2023,\\\\nthe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of\\\\nwhich $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax\\\\nrate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax\\\\nbenefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would have\\\\nimpacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance\\\\nof gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for\\\\n2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Beginning\\\\nbalances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475 Increases related to tax positions taken\\\\nduring a prior year 2,044 2,284 816 Decreases related to tax positions taken\\\\nduring a prior year ( 1,463 ) ( 1,982 ) ( 1,402 ) Increases related to tax\\\\npositions taken during the current year 2,628 1,936 1,607 Decreases related to\\\\nsettlements with taxing authorities ( 19 ) ( 28 ) ( 1,838 ) Decreases related\\\\nto expiration of the statute of limitations ( 494 ) ( 929 ) ( 181 ) Ending\\\\nbalances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477 The Company is subject to taxation and\\\\nfiles income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and\\\\nforeign jurisd ictions.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41 European\\\\nCommission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission\\\\nannounced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by\\\\nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of\\\\nprofits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State\\\\nAid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\\\\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through\\\\nDecember 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015,\\\\neliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\\\\nrecovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\\\\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the\\\\nGeneral Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General\\\\nCourt”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.\\\\nOn September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s\\\\ndecision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held\\\\non May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024.\\\\nThe Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit\\\\nfor a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due\\\\nrelated to the State Aid Decision. On an annual basis, the Company may request\\\\napproval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for\\\\ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted\\\\nrecovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery\\\\namount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted\\\\nfrom general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The\\\\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management,\\\\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred\\\\na material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,\\\\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally\\\\navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained\\\\nfrom single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used\\\\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are\\\\nat times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing\\\\nfluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly\\\\nused by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often\\\\nutilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until\\\\nthe suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\\\nCompany’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products\\\\nare manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China\\\\nmainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based\\\\non net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are\\\\ngenerally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s\\\\nretail stores located in those geographic locations.

We also have audited, in accordance with the\\\\nstandards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of\\\\nSeptember 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023\\\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial\\\\nstatements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our\\\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\\\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\\\\nand are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\\\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\\\nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\\\\naudits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\\\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\\\\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\\\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\\\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\\\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\\\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\\\\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\\\\nopinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is\\\\na matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\\\nand that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\\\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\\\nor complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\\\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\\\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\\\\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure\\\\nto which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As\\\\ndiscussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\\\\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\\\\nmany state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total\\\\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5\\\\nbillion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In\\\\naccounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses\\\\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic\\\\nand international tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an\\\\nuncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the\\\\nmeasurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves\\\\nsignificant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal\\\\nrulings. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49 How We Addressed the Matter in Our\\\\nAudit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax\\\\npositions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax\\\\npositions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to\\\\nmeasure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related\\\\ndisclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are\\\\nmore likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among\\\\nothers, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as\\\\napplicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed\\\\nthe basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our\\\\ntax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of\\\\nApple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and\\\\nexperience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also\\\\nreceived external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters\\\\nwith external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated\\\\nApple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the\\\\nfinancial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s\\\\nauditor since 2009. San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023\\\\nForm 10-K | 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the\\\\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal\\\\nControl Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria\\\\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\\\n“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\\\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\\\n30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with\\\\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\\\n30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of\\\\noperations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each\\\\nof the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related\\\\nnotes and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion\\\\nthereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for\\\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple\\\\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\\\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\\\nindependent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\\\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in\\\\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\\\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\\\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\\\\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\\\\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\\\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 2, 2023\\\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with\\\\nAccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and\\\\nProcedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an\\\\nevaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\\\\nofficer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\\\\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were\\\\neffective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files\\\\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\\\\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\\\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\\\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations\\\\nover Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\\\npurposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain\\\\nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\\\\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that\\\\nthe Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with\\\\nauthorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide\\\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a\\\\nmaterial effect on the financial statements. Management, including the\\\\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect\\\\nthat the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all\\\\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\\\\nonly reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\\\\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\\\\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\\\\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all\\\\ncontrol systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\\\\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\\\\ndetected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\\\\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become\\\\ninadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of\\\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s\\\\nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s\\\\nmanagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\\\\nExchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\\\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set\\\\nforth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\\\\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on\\\\nthe Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control\\\\nover financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide\\\\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s\\\\nindependent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued\\\\nan audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting,\\\\nwhich appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal\\\\nControl over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s\\\\ninternal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023,\\\\nwhich were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by\\\\nparagraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have\\\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\\\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 1 Services Advertising The\\\\nCompany’s advertising services include various third-party licensing\\\\narrangements and the Company’s own advertising platforms. AppleCare The\\\\nCompany offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the\\\\nAppleCare brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\\\\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and\\\\nreplacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of\\\\naccidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of\\\\nproduct. Cloud Services The Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’\\\\ncontent up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows\\\\npersonal computers. Digital Content The Company operates various platforms,\\\\nincluding the App Store that allow customers to discover and download\\\\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and\\\\npodcasts.

Payment Services The Company offers payment\\\\nservices, including Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a\\\\ncashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are\\\\nprimarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise\\\\nand government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party\\\\nproducts in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-\\\\nsized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\\\\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also\\\\nemploys a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party\\\\ncellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022,\\\\nthe Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels\\\\naccounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The\\\\nmarkets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and\\\\nare characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,\\\\nshort product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\\\nin product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part\\\\nof consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete\\\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by\\\\nimitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the\\\\ncontinuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\\\\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\\\\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\\\\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive\\\\nfactors important to the Company include price, product and service features\\\\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and\\\\nservice quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party\\\\nsoftware and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability,\\\\nservice and support, and corporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2\\\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to\\\\nsmartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and\\\\nservices. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\\\\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other\\\\nresources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\\\\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\\\\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\\\\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or\\\\nno profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business\\\\nmodels that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to\\\\nobtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces\\\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features\\\\nand applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\\\\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of\\\\nComponents Although most components essential to the Company’s business are\\\\ngenerally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently\\\\nobtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used\\\\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are\\\\nat times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing\\\\nfluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly\\\\nused by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often\\\\nutilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until\\\\nthe suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\\\nCompany’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply\\\\nof many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will\\\\nbe able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by\\\\noutsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac\\\\ncomputers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development\\\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by\\\\nrapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully\\\\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\\\\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\\\nCompany continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and\\\\nservices, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and\\\\ndevelopment (“R&D;”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of\\\\nthird-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company\\\\ncurrently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to\\\\ncertain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services.\\\\nThis includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of\\\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries.\\\\nAlthough the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property\\\\nrights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its\\\\nsuccess does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on\\\\nthe innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its\\\\npersonnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark\\\\napplications to protect innovations arising from its research, development,\\\\ndesign and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications\\\\naround the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of\\\\nissued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single\\\\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual\\\\nproperty rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and\\\\nservices. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the\\\\nCompany’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property\\\\nowned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew\\\\nlicenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and\\\\nservices. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such\\\\nlicenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The\\\\nCompany has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter\\\\ncompared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\\\\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect\\\\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory\\\\nfollowing a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often\\\\ndeclines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be\\\\naffected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\\\nHuman Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated\\\\nteam, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for\\\\nall of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had\\\\napproximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and\\\\nPolicies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion\\\\nand diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or\\\\ndiscrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that\\\\ncompensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees\\\\nto share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most\\\\nlikely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time\\\\nand support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of\\\\nthis, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the\\\\nworld and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support\\\\nemployees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The\\\\nCompany remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive\\\\nworkforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\\\\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an\\\\ninclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\\\\nemployees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication\\\\namong team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative\\\\nwork environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members\\\\nare encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns,\\\\nand the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like\\\\ncareer development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The\\\\nCompany is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates.\\\\nThe Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures\\\\nto mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general\\\\nsafety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\\\\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.\\\\nAdditionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\\\\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company\\\\nhas also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19\\\\npandemic. Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K,\\\\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to\\\\nreports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange\\\\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A.\\\\nRisk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors,\\\\nwhether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any\\\\none or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following\\\\nfactors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of\\\\noperations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be\\\\nconsidered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors\\\\nshould not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future\\\\nperiods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\\\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and\\\\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item\\\\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance\\\\ndepend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse\\\\neconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. The Company has international\\\\noperations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the\\\\nCompany’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is\\\\nlarge and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities,\\\\nincluding manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a\\\\nresult, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on\\\\nglobal and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions,\\\\nincluding inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\\\\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter\\\\ncredit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can\\\\nadversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\\\naffect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer\\\\nconfidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to\\\\nfinancial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real\\\\nestate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy\\\\nshortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic\\\\nfactors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s\\\\nproducts, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic\\\\nconditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\\\\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers\\\\nand other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability;\\\\ninability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the\\\\nCompany’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment can\\\\nalso lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade\\\\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial\\\\ninstitutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\\\\ninstruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. The Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\\\nstock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially\\\\nadversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and continues\\\\nto have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\\\\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have\\\\nincluded restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of\\\\nbusinesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic\\\\nhas at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused\\\\nsignificant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have\\\\nadversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component\\\\nsuppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced\\\\ndisruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and\\\\nsimilar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also\\\\nadversely impact consumer demand for the Company’s products and services in\\\\naffected areas. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5 The Company continues to\\\\nmonitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the\\\\nrecommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which\\\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and financial\\\\nperformance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the\\\\nCompany’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of\\\\nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability,\\\\ndistribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of\\\\nprotective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\\\\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional\\\\nfuture impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand\\\\nfor the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales\\\\nand distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic\\\\nplans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect\\\\nof heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of\\\\nthis Form 10-K. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events,\\\\ntrade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters,\\\\npublic health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\\\\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other\\\\nbusiness interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the\\\\nglobal economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and\\\\nits customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The\\\\nCompany has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing\\\\na majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\\\\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of\\\\nthe Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing\\\\npartners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan,\\\\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other\\\\ninternational conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures\\\\nthat restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the\\\\nCompany derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\\\\nsupply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have\\\\nled to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China\\\\nmainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of\\\\nthe Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into\\\\nmaking them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that\\\\nthe Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s\\\\nproducts more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products\\\\nless competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other\\\\nmeasures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data,\\\\nthat could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and\\\\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed.\\\\nThese measures can require the Company to take various actions, including\\\\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer\\\\nthird-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations\\\\nin accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-\\\\nconsuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be\\\\nannounced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to\\\\neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and\\\\nconflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response\\\\ncould be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding\\\\ntrade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on\\\\nconsumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical\\\\nbusiness operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are\\\\nin locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\\\\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of\\\\ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other\\\\nindustrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\\\\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including\\\\npandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s\\\\ncontrol. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural\\\\ndisasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events\\\\ncan make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\\\\nproducts to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s\\\\nsupply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the\\\\nCompany’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the\\\\nCompany can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\\\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the\\\\nCompany relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of\\\\nmany critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would\\\\nexacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form\\\\n10-K | 6 The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial\\\\naccidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s\\\\nsuppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations,\\\\nan industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or\\\\nloss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s\\\\nreputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially\\\\nadversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and\\\\ndemand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\\\\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on\\\\nfreight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions\\\\nin the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting\\\\nin interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production\\\\nramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for\\\\ncertain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover\\\\nall losses that may arise. Global markets for the Company’s products and\\\\nservices are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and\\\\nthe Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The\\\\nCompany’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global\\\\nmarkets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,\\\\nshort product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\\\nin product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part\\\\nof consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully\\\\ndepends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\\\nCompany designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products,\\\\nincluding the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\\\\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments\\\\nin R&D.; There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected\\\\nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\\\\nand services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of\\\\npatents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of\\\\nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing\\\\nand very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and\\\\ninfringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property\\\\nprotection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company\\\\noperates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative\\\\nnew products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the\\\\nCompany’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a\\\\ncompetitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has\\\\na minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet\\\\nmarkets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\\\\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other\\\\nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content\\\\nsupplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\\\\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\\\\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\\\\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or\\\\nno profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes\\\\nhave from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate\\\\nthe Company’s product features and applications within their products or\\\\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\\\\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as\\\\ncompetitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly\\\\nwithin their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from\\\\ncompanies that have significant resources and experience and have established\\\\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with\\\\nbusiness models that provide content to users for free. The Company also\\\\ncompetes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\\\napplications. The Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve\\\\nits products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.\\\\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide\\\\nproducts and services that compete effectively. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K |\\\\n7 Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the\\\\nCompany must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of\\\\nproducts and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of\\\\nthe markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\\\\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance\\\\nexisting products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new\\\\nand upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to\\\\nthese new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and\\\\nservice introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and\\\\nsuccessful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the\\\\nrisks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of\\\\napplication software for the Company’s products, the effective management of\\\\npurchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product\\\\ndemand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected\\\\ncosts to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services\\\\nmay have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance\\\\nthe Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of\\\\nproducts and services. The Company depends on component and product\\\\nmanufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many\\\\nof which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s\\\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\\\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan\\\\nand Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is\\\\ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single\\\\nlocations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require\\\\nconsiderable time and resources and involve significant risks and\\\\nuncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\\\\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they\\\\nalso reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.\\\\nSuch diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an\\\\nadverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services\\\\nprovided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\\\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions\\\\nfor product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\\\\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the\\\\nevent of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect\\\\nliabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to\\\\nadhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of\\\\nconduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and\\\\nEurope to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners\\\\nprimarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\\\\nCompany’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have\\\\na negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished\\\\ngoods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit\\\\nto final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including\\\\nnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,\\\\ncommercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental,\\\\npublic health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The\\\\nCompany has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held\\\\nat certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of\\\\nits suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these\\\\narrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these\\\\noutsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or\\\\nother disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\\\\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or\\\\nprepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain\\\\ncomponents from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that\\\\nare available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\\\nshortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high\\\\ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient\\\\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at\\\\nall. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\\\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or\\\\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may\\\\nsuffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for\\\\nthe supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\\\\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s\\\\noperations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\\\\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\\\n” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components Therefore,\\\\nthe Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\\\\nincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8 The\\\\nCompany’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one\\\\nsource. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity\\\\nconstraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\\\\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of\\\\nreasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of\\\\ncommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing\\\\nproduct has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has\\\\ndelayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely\\\\naffected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany’s business and financial performance could also be materially\\\\nadversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\\\\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\\\\nfrom an alternative source. The Company’s products and services may be\\\\naffected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the\\\\nCompany’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software\\\\nproducts and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\\\\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as\\\\nthose offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly\\\\ninterfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products.\\\\nDefects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from\\\\nthird parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and\\\\ncreate a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These\\\\nrisks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\\\\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings\\\\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service\\\\nslowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time\\\\nhave not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.\\\\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all\\\\nissues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure\\\\nto do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting\\\\nthe Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed\\\\nto product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications,\\\\nwrite-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible\\\\nassets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation\\\\ncosts and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the\\\\nexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in\\\\nharm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\\\\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and\\\\nservice introductions and lost sales. The Company is exposed to the risk of\\\\nwrite-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\\\\npurchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for\\\\nproduct and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\\\\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The\\\\nCompany also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess\\\\nproducts and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including\\\\ncapital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments,\\\\nfor impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be\\\\nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it\\\\nrecords a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the\\\\nasset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory,\\\\ncapital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase\\\\ncommitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company\\\\nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the\\\\nrapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in\\\\nwhich the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and\\\\nbuilds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\\\\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component\\\\nand manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because\\\\nthe Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid\\\\ntechnology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\\\\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\\\\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company\\\\nrelies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be\\\\navailable to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The\\\\nCompany’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property\\\\nowned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\\\\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the\\\\nCompany currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive\\\\npatent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\\\\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has\\\\nbeen notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual\\\\nproperty rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\\\\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can\\\\ngenerally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be\\\\nno assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual\\\\nproperty, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or\\\\notherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 The\\\\nCompany’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party\\\\nsoftware developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase\\\\nits hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\\\\nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party\\\\ndevelopers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and\\\\nservices cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products,\\\\ncustomers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes\\\\nthe availability of third-party software applications and services for its\\\\nproducts depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the\\\\nrelative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such\\\\nas Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and\\\\ntablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This\\\\nanalysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company\\\\nand its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications\\\\nand services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone,\\\\npersonal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to\\\\ndevelop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to\\\\ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’\\\\nproducts with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for\\\\nthe Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued\\\\navailability and development of compelling and innovative software\\\\napplications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems\\\\nare subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are\\\\nunable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\\\\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved\\\\ncustomer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in\\\\ndissatisfied customers. The Company distributes third-party applications for\\\\nits products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications,\\\\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company\\\\nonly retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital\\\\nservices or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has\\\\nmade changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\\\\ncompetition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further\\\\nbusiness changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the\\\\nEuropean Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The\\\\nCompany is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App\\\\nStore, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and\\\\nmay in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how\\\\nand to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms\\\\nand manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce\\\\nthe volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales,\\\\nwould decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such\\\\nsales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be\\\\nmaterially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content\\\\nthat appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\\\\ncontracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to\\\\ncustomers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-\\\\nparty content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the\\\\nCompany’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for\\\\nthis content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the\\\\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors\\\\ncurrently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can\\\\ntake actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or\\\\notherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or\\\\ndistributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost\\\\nof, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide\\\\nvariety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage\\\\nrules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly\\\\nto produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\\\\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19\\\\npandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased\\\\ncosts for digital content. Some third-party digital content providers require\\\\nthe Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.\\\\nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new\\\\ntechnology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company\\\\nwill be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in\\\\na timely manner. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10 The Company’s success\\\\ndepends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued\\\\nservice and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel,\\\\nand the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\\\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its\\\\nteam members, the continued availability and service of key personnel,\\\\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled\\\\nemployees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\\\\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\\\\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense\\\\ncompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the\\\\nCompany does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational\\\\nflexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture\\\\nis a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture\\\\nits culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to\\\\nrecruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its\\\\nsuccess, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\\\nother resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its\\\\nservices through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\\\nresellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors.\\\\nThe Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party\\\\nproducts in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-\\\\nsized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\\\\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers\\\\nproviding cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing,\\\\ninstallment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device.\\\\nThere can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same\\\\namounts. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to\\\\nenhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with\\\\nCompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\\\\nThese programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return\\\\nor incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,\\\\nthese resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty\\\\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause\\\\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology\\\\nsystem failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply\\\\nchain are exposed to information technology system failures or network\\\\ndisruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,\\\\ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses,\\\\nphysical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents,\\\\nor other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity\\\\nmeasures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’\\\\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for\\\\nall eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s\\\\nonline services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the\\\\nmanufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or\\\\nreleases of confidential information, including personal information, could\\\\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and\\\\noperational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store\\\\nconfidential information, including personal information, with respect to the\\\\nCompany’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources\\\\nto network and data security, including through the use of encryption and\\\\nother security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these\\\\nmeasures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access\\\\nto or releases of confidential information occur and could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. The Company’s business also requires it to share\\\\nconfidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company\\\\nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other\\\\nmalicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company\\\\ntakes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or\\\\naccessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are\\\\nnot always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\\\\nconfidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks\\\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results\\\\nof operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11 The\\\\nCompany experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized\\\\naccess to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the\\\\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or\\\\ndisrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the\\\\nCompany’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and\\\\nservices, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial\\\\nrelationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government\\\\ninvestigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against\\\\nthe Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\\\\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and\\\\ntechniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and\\\\nremove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s\\\\nability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition,\\\\nattacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of\\\\nsevere diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to\\\\ngain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a\\\\nrelatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the\\\\nvalue of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\\\nprocesses. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to\\\\nsecure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to\\\\nor loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access,\\\\nincluding through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As\\\\nwith all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all\\\\neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee\\\\nerror, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\\\\nirregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the\\\\nCompany’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names,\\\\npasswords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for\\\\nunauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To\\\\nhelp protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes\\\\navailable technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services\\\\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious\\\\ncircumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of\\\\ncustomer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and\\\\nservices. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to\\\\naddress certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be\\\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the\\\\nCompany’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the\\\\nfuture may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\\\\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of\\\\nmanagement from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and\\\\nexpenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with\\\\noperating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on\\\\ncapital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and\\\\nsignificant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\\\\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on\\\\na timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could\\\\ndelay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit\\\\nthe Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a\\\\ntransaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be\\\\nsuccessful. The failure of any significant investment could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. The Company’s retail stores have required and will\\\\ncontinue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and\\\\nare subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores\\\\nhave required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\\\\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered\\\\ninto substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been\\\\ndesigned and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness.\\\\nBecause of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores\\\\nrequire substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail\\\\nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail\\\\nstores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual\\\\nstore or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety\\\\nmeasures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant\\\\nlease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements\\\\nand severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many\\\\nfactors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including\\\\nmacro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail\\\\nactivity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs\\\\nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships\\\\nwith existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in\\\\nthe value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail\\\\nlocations at a reasonable cost. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12 Legal and\\\\nRegulatory Compliance Risks The Company’s business, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of\\\\nlegal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to\\\\nvarious claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have\\\\narisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully\\\\nresolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements\\\\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which\\\\ncan subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against\\\\nan indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\\\\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of\\\\nsuch claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\\\\nincreased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and\\\\ncontinues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its\\\\ncellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For\\\\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their\\\\npatents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on\\\\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual\\\\nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in\\\\ncourts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various\\\\ncountries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and\\\\nsubstantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending\\\\nagainst litigation or responding to government investigations can be\\\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In\\\\nrecognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or\\\\nother arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can\\\\nbe no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\\\nlitigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase\\\\nthe Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\\\\nchange its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain\\\\nproducts and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K\\\\nunder the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\\\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and\\\\nContingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of\\\\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may\\\\nhave incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\\\\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently\\\\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or\\\\nan indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above\\\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\\\nFurther, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or\\\\ntrebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\\\\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require\\\\nthe Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability\\\\nto offer certain products and services, all of which could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for\\\\ncertain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover\\\\nall losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to\\\\ncomplex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company\\\\nto potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the\\\\nCompany’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and\\\\nchanging laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data\\\\nsecurity and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\\\\nbilling and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability;\\\\nintellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet,\\\\ntelecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and\\\\ndigital content; availability of third-party software applications and\\\\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade;\\\\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money\\\\nlaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\\\\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13 Compliance with these laws and regulations is\\\\nonerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the\\\\nCompany’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers,\\\\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and\\\\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and\\\\nchanging laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws\\\\nand regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may\\\\nincrease as the Company’s products and services are introduced into\\\\nspecialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company\\\\nhas implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\\\\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s\\\\nemployees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or\\\\nthe Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have\\\\nviolated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the\\\\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\\\\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating\\\\nto the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs,\\\\npolicies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory\\\\nrequirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will\\\\nbe effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result,\\\\nthe Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either\\\\nof which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to\\\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to\\\\npotential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse\\\\neffects on the Company’s business. Many governments, regulators, investors,\\\\nemployees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\\\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses,\\\\nincluding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights,\\\\nand diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements\\\\nabout its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through\\\\nits environmental, social and governance report, its other non-financial\\\\nreports, information provided on its website, press statements and other\\\\ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\\\\nconsiderations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves\\\\nrisks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\\\\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company\\\\ncannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and\\\\ngovernance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree\\\\nwith the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure,\\\\nby the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its\\\\npublic statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental,\\\\nsocial and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied\\\\nstakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory\\\\nproceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is\\\\nsubject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the\\\\nCompany to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and\\\\npenalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store,\\\\nincluding actions taken in response to competition, market and legal\\\\nconditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New\\\\nlegislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws\\\\nin other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could\\\\ninclude how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to\\\\nits platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. The\\\\nCompany is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various\\\\njurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and\\\\nclaims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have\\\\na materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations\\\\nand financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of\\\\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms\\\\nand conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the\\\\nCompany, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required\\\\nto make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App\\\\nStore, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and\\\\nmay in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has\\\\ncommercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that\\\\nare or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved\\\\nagainst those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nFor example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other\\\\ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps,\\\\nand certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government\\\\ninvestigations and legal proceedings. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14 There\\\\ncan be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely\\\\naffected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\\\\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\\\\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and\\\\nregulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively\\\\nimpact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\\\\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products\\\\nand services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of\\\\ncompetitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\\\\nservices, and lost sales. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of\\\\nU.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding\\\\ndata protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international\\\\nlaws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of\\\\nvarious types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not\\\\nonly to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal\\\\ninformation among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several\\\\njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are\\\\nconsidering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending.\\\\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to\\\\njurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\\\\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future\\\\nrequire the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could\\\\nresult in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes\\\\nstatements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its\\\\nprivacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and\\\\nother privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to\\\\ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or\\\\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in\\\\ninquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or\\\\nothers. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing\\\\naudit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks\\\\ngenerally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of\\\\npersonal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations\\\\nrelating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as\\\\nhealth data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data\\\\nare subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification\\\\nrequirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities\\\\nregarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company\\\\nfails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health\\\\ndata or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under\\\\nthe Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the\\\\nCompany can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be\\\\nliable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant\\\\nfees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements.\\\\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is\\\\npotentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated\\\\ninvestigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the\\\\nCompany fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The\\\\nCompany could also experience a significant increase in payment card\\\\ntransaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to\\\\nfollow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net\\\\nsales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins\\\\nvary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution\\\\nchannels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and\\\\nservices vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross\\\\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of\\\\nfactors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures\\\\nand product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such\\\\npressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively\\\\nstimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product\\\\nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components,\\\\noutside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\\\\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product\\\\nquality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and\\\\nservices, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the\\\\nextent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and\\\\nservice offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other\\\\nmacroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\\\\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and\\\\nother factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results\\\\nof operations and financial condition. The Company has historically\\\\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters\\\\nin its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new\\\\nproduct and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\\\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\\\\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for\\\\nthat product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could\\\\nalso be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\\\\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or\\\\nservice introductions, information technology system failures or network\\\\ndisruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\\\\nor manufacturing partners. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15 The Company’s\\\\nfinancial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value\\\\nof the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary\\\\nexposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\\\\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide.\\\\nGross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products\\\\nthat include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\\\\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The\\\\nweakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects\\\\nthe U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and\\\\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing,\\\\npotentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances,\\\\nfor competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise\\\\ninternational pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would\\\\nadversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns\\\\non foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the\\\\nCompany to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\\\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product\\\\ncomponents denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross\\\\nmargins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency\\\\nforward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\\\\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial\\\\neffects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited\\\\ntime the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and\\\\nfluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s\\\\ninvestments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit\\\\ndeterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\\\\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a\\\\nresult, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and\\\\nmarketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.\\\\nTherefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its\\\\ncash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future\\\\nfluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have\\\\na material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts\\\\nreceivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term\\\\nsupply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\\\nconditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its\\\\nservices through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\\\\nand resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to\\\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\\\\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade\\\\nreceivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or\\\\nfinancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network\\\\ncarriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\\\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain\\\\ninternational markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\\\\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from\\\\npurchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\\\nmanufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In\\\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply\\\\nagreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022,\\\\nthe Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\\\\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\\\\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is\\\\nsubject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax\\\\nlegislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject\\\\nto taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland,\\\\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic\\\\nand political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other\\\\nnon-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\\\\nchange. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix\\\\nof earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the\\\\nvaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new\\\\ntaxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S.\\\\nand Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form\\\\n10-K | 16 The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns\\\\nand other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax\\\\nauthorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the\\\\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to\\\\ndetermine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance\\\\nas to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates\\\\nwere to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate\\\\ndetermination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of\\\\namounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The\\\\nprice of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock has\\\\nexperienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so\\\\nin the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the\\\\nstock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock\\\\nprice and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may\\\\nhave been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price\\\\nvolatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its\\\\nstock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time.\\\\nThe Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of\\\\nfuture growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its\\\\nstock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at\\\\ncurrent levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be\\\\nfully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the\\\\nCompany’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does\\\\nnot obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails\\\\nto meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\\\\nrepurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\\\\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor\\\\nconfidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.\\\\nItem 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino,\\\\nCalifornia. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities\\\\nand land for corporate functions, R&D;, data centers, retail and other\\\\npurposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the\\\\nU.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are\\\\nused by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are\\\\nsuitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games\\\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\\\\nNorthern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”)\\\\nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws\\\\nand California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of\\\\nits App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On\\\\nSeptember 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of\\\\nthe Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s\\\\nclaim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for\\\\nbreach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain\\\\nprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s\\\\nunfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision.\\\\nThe Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the\\\\nappeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal\\\\nproceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\\\\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during\\\\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have\\\\na material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.\\\\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal\\\\nmatters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts\\\\nabove management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\\\naffected.

Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year\\\\ncomparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can\\\\nbe found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\\\nResults of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on\\\\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. Fiscal Year Highlights\\\\nFiscal 2022 Highlights Total net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during\\\\n2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone,\\\\nServices and Mac. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\\\\ndollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services\\\\nnet sales during 2022. The Company announces new product, service and software\\\\nofferings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during\\\\nfiscal 2022 included the following: First Quarter 2022: Updated MacBook Pro\\\\n14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and Third\\\\ngeneration of AirPods. Second Quarter 2022: Updated iPhone SE with 5G\\\\ntechnology; All-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;\\\\nAll-new Studio Display™; and Updated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by\\\\nthe Apple M1 chip. Third Quarter 2022: Updated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro\\\\n13”, both powered by the Apple M2 chip; iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and\\\\nwatchOS 9, updates to the Company’s operating systems; and Apple Pay Later, a\\\\nbuy now, pay later service. Fourth Quarter 2022: iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus,\\\\niPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max; Second generation of AirPods Pro; and\\\\nApple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra. In\\\\nApril 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization\\\\nfrom $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22\\\\nto $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased\\\\n$90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents\\\\nof $14.8 billion. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to\\\\nhave, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\\\\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and\\\\nbusiness operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and\\\\nshelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly\\\\ncurtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\\\\ndisruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures\\\\ntaken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future\\\\nmaterially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers\\\\nand logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could\\\\noccur in the future.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products\\\\nand Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2022, 2021 and 2020\\\\nwere as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Gross margin: Products $\\\\n114,728 $ 105,126 $ 69,461 Services 56,054 47,710 35,495 Total gross margin $\\\\n170,782 $ 152,836 $ 104,956 Gross margin percentage: Products 36.3 % 35.3 %\\\\n31.5 % Services 71.7 % 69.7 % 66.0 % Total gross margin percentage 43.3 % 41.8\\\\n% 38.2 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin increased during 2022\\\\ncompared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix and higher Products\\\\nvolume, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the\\\\nU.S. dollar. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared\\\\nto 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix, partially offset by the\\\\nweakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross\\\\nMargin Services gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due\\\\nprimarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services gross margin\\\\npercentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to improved\\\\nleverage and a different Services mix, partially offset by the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company’s future gross\\\\nmargins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item\\\\n1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the\\\\nCompany believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and\\\\ndownward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2022, 2021 and\\\\n2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\\\\nResearch and development $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 17 % $ 18,752 Percentage of\\\\ntotal net sales 7 % 6 % 7 % Selling, general and administrative $ 25,094 14 %\\\\n$ 21,973 10 % $ 19,916 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 6 % 7 % Total\\\\noperating expenses $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 13 % $ 38,668 Percentage of total\\\\nnet sales 13 % 12 % 14 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in\\\\nR&D; expense in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related\\\\nexpenses and engineering program costs. Selling, General and Administrative\\\\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in\\\\n2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses,\\\\nadvertising and professional services. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 23 Other\\\\nIncome/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E;”) for 2022, 2021 and\\\\n2020 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\\\\nInterest and dividend income $ 2,825 $ 2,843 $ 3,763 Interest expense (2,931)\\\\n(2,645) (2,873) Other income/(expense), net (228) 60 (87) Total other\\\\nincome/(expense), net $ (334) (229) % $ 258 (68) % $ 803 The decrease in OI&E;\\\\nduring 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to higher realized losses on\\\\ndebt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity securities and\\\\nhigher interest expense, partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains.\\\\nProvision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and\\\\nstatutory federal income tax rate for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows\\\\n(dollars in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 19,300 $\\\\n14,527 $ 9,680 Effective tax rate 16.2 % 13.3 % 14.4 % Statutory federal\\\\nincome tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was\\\\nlower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower\\\\neffective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based\\\\ncompensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D; credit, partially offset\\\\nby state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower\\\\nthan the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective\\\\ntax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and\\\\nforeign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate\\\\nfor 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax\\\\nrate on foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as\\\\na result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\\\nin 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income\\\\ndeductions and share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The\\\\nCompany believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted\\\\nmarketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022,\\\\nalong with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt\\\\nmarkets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital\\\\nreturn program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash\\\\nrequirements include the following contractual obligations. Debt As of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying\\\\nmaturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively\\\\nthe “Notes”), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest\\\\npayments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term\\\\npromissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.\\\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper\\\\noutstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has\\\\nlease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate,\\\\ndata center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the\\\\nCompany had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0\\\\nbillion payable within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24\\\\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing\\\\npartners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\\\\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also\\\\nobtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of\\\\nindividual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build\\\\nproduct based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically\\\\ncovers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had\\\\nmanufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are\\\\nprimarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other\\\\npurchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire\\\\ncapital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and\\\\nnoncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation.\\\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8\\\\nbillion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax\\\\nPayable As of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax\\\\npayable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was\\\\n$22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. In\\\\naddition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital\\\\nreturn program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not\\\\nobligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\\\n24, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The\\\\nCompany intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to\\\\ndeclaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The\\\\npreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with\\\\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s\\\\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\\\\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates\\\\nthat affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\\\\nPolicies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8\\\\nof this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods\\\\nused in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\\\\nassumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\\\\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\\\\nassets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to\\\\nincome taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of\\\\nthe Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the\\\\ninterpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international\\\\ntax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\\\\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes\\\\nthe Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the\\\\nfinal outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is\\\\nreflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\\\\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\\\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\\\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition\\\\nand operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to\\\\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of\\\\nbusiness, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records\\\\na liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount\\\\nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant\\\\njudgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with\\\\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25\\\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest\\\\nRate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its\\\\nforeign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on\\\\na stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency\\\\nand interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s\\\\nrisk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\\\\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the\\\\nfinancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or\\\\ninterest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\\\\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related\\\\nto the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The\\\\nCompany’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the\\\\nCompany’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is\\\\nexposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by\\\\nfluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the\\\\ninterest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\\\nsecurities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated\\\\nwith hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment\\\\npolicy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting\\\\nthe Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of\\\\ninternal and external management to execute its investment strategy and\\\\nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly\\\\nrated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk\\\\nof principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires\\\\nsecurities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to\\\\nany one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\\\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a\\\\nsensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\\\\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point\\\\nparallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point\\\\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0\\\\nbillion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\\\\nportfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company\\\\nsold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 24, 2022, the Company\\\\nhad outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had\\\\noutstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\\\\naggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively.\\\\nThe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps\\\\nto manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps\\\\nallow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-\\\\nrate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and\\\\nlosses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains\\\\non the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market\\\\ninterest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186\\\\nmillion on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In\\\\ngeneral, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S.\\\\ndollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\\\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\\\\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the\\\\nCompany will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive\\\\npressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\\\\nexchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\\\\ncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange\\\\nrisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly\\\\ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in\\\\nforeign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future\\\\nmay enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt\\\\nissuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign\\\\ncurrency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\\\\nfor up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain\\\\nforeign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting\\\\nconsiderations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\\\\nexposures. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26 To provide an assessment of the\\\\nforeign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis\\\\nusing a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of\\\\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo\\\\nsimulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal\\\\nmarket conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a\\\\ngiven confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\\\\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to\\\\nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool.\\\\nForecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\\\\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the\\\\nresults of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum\\\\none-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared\\\\nto a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25,\\\\n2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging\\\\npurposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally\\\\noffset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual\\\\nfuture gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio,\\\\ndebt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity\\\\nanalyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations\\\\nassociated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and\\\\npositions.

Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2022 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\\\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and\\\\nPreparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of\\\\nApple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the\\\\n“Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The\\\\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\\\\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\\\\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.\\\\nActual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior\\\\nperiod amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\\\\nhave been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The\\\\nCompany’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last\\\\nSaturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal\\\\nquarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\\\\ncalendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s\\\\nfiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021\\\\nand 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to\\\\nparticular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal\\\\nyears ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\\\\nthose fiscal years. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the\\\\nsale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes\\\\nrevenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the\\\\nproducts or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally\\\\ntransferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are\\\\ntransferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales,\\\\ncontrol transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net\\\\nsales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for\\\\nProducts and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\\\\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product\\\\nreturns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\\\\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with\\\\nmultiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an\\\\narrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct\\\\nperformance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices\\\\n(“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\\\\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that\\\\nreflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the\\\\nperformance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone\\\\nbasis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices\\\\nconsiders multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and\\\\ncircumstances related to each performance obligation including, where\\\\napplicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends\\\\nin the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and\\\\nthe estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has\\\\nidentified up to three performance obligations regularly included in\\\\narrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software\\\\ndelivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right\\\\nto receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ,\\\\nSiri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a\\\\nwhen-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to\\\\nthe software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any\\\\nrelated discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\\\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered\\\\nperformance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s\\\\nestimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled\\\\nsoftware is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is\\\\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\\\\nthey are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware\\\\nand bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at\\\\nthe time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services\\\\nand unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as\\\\nincurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has\\\\nperformance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these\\\\narrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered\\\\nservices. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates\\\\nentirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company\\\\nhas not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these\\\\nundelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34 For the sale of third-\\\\nparty products where the Company obtains control of the product before\\\\ntransferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the\\\\ngross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including\\\\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory\\\\nrisk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring\\\\nacceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the\\\\nApp Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital\\\\ncontent stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before\\\\ntransferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such\\\\nsales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission\\\\nit retains. The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers\\\\nthat are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes\\\\nrecorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\\\\ngovernment authority. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures\\\\nshare-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common\\\\nstock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis\\\\nfor its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further\\\\ninformation regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,\\\\n“Benefit Plans.” Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation\\\\nof basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in\\\\nmillions and shares in thousands): 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $\\\\n99,803 $ 94,680 $ 57,411 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares\\\\noutstanding 16,215,963 16,701,272 17,352,119 Effect of dilutive securities\\\\n109,856 163,647 176,095 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,325,819 16,864,919\\\\n17,528,214 Basic earnings per share $ 6.15 $ 5.67 $ 3.31 Diluted earnings per\\\\nshare $ 6.11 $ 5.61 $ 3.28 The Company applies the treasury stock method to\\\\ndetermine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Cash\\\\nEquivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with\\\\nmaturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\\\\ncash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have\\\\nbeen classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company\\\\nclassifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term\\\\nbased on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. The Company’s\\\\ninvestments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature\\\\nof the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The\\\\ncost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification\\\\nmethod. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out\\\\nmethod. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35 Restricted Marketable Securities The\\\\nCompany considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or\\\\ngeneral use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable\\\\nsecurities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated\\\\nBalance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\\\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is\\\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\\\\nassets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life\\\\nof the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment,\\\\nincluding manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful\\\\nlife for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use\\\\nsoftware are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\\\\nlives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and\\\\namortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7 billion, $9.5\\\\nbillion and $9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Derivative\\\\nInstruments and Hedging All derivative instruments are recorded in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for\\\\nderivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\\\\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of\\\\ncash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other\\\\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into\\\\nearnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line\\\\nitem in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as\\\\ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge\\\\neffectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the\\\\nhedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the\\\\nhedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the\\\\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive\\\\nincome/(loss) (“OCI”). Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included\\\\nin the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the\\\\nConsolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates\\\\nalong with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the\\\\nhedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value\\\\nhedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment\\\\nof hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net\\\\n(“OI&E;”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the\\\\nfair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\\\\nrecognized in OCI. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of\\\\nderivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are\\\\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which\\\\nthe derivative instruments relate. The Company presents derivative assets and\\\\nliabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\\\\nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating\\\\nactivities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair Value\\\\nMeasurements The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain\\\\nmarketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for\\\\nidentical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of\\\\nthe Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which\\\\ngenerally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted\\\\nmarket prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\\\\nor corroborated by observable market data. Income Taxes The Company records\\\\ncertain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax\\\\non certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\\\n(the “Act”). Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease\\\\ncomponents as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center\\\\nand retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease\\\\nliabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental\\\\nborrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot\\\\nbe readily determined. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36 Segment Reporting The\\\\nCompany reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The\\\\nmanagement approach designates the internal reporting used by management for\\\\nmaking decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\\\\nreportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a\\\\ngeographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,\\\\nEurope, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both\\\\nNorth and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India,\\\\nthe Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries\\\\nnot included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the\\\\nreportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar\\\\nservices, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of\\\\nthe Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market\\\\ndynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various\\\\nsegments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of\\\\nSignificant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its\\\\nreportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for\\\\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales\\\\nthrough the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations.\\\\nOperating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related\\\\ncost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.\\\\nAdvertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which\\\\nthe expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes\\\\nother income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable\\\\nsegments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various\\\\ncorporate expenses such as research and development (“R&D;”), corporate\\\\nmarketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,\\\\nvarious nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and\\\\nadministrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\\\\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes. Note 2 – Revenue Net sales\\\\ndisaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020\\\\nwere as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 iPhone (1) $ 205,489 $ 191,973 $\\\\n137,781 Mac (1) 40,177 35,190 28,622 iPad (1) 29,292 31,862 23,724 Wearables,\\\\nHome and Accessories (1)(2) 41,241 38,367 30,620 Services (3) 78,129 68,425\\\\n53,768 Total net sales (4) $ 394,328 $ 365,817 $ 274,515 (1) Products net\\\\nsales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software\\\\nupgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective\\\\nproduct. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of\\\\nAirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\\\\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising,\\\\nAppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net\\\\nsales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $7.5 billion of revenue\\\\nrecognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25,\\\\n2021, $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred\\\\nrevenue as of September 26, 2020, and $5.0 billion of revenue recognized in\\\\n2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019. The\\\\nCompany’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was\\\\ngenerally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment\\\\nInformation and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater\\\\nChina, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net\\\\nsales in 2022 and 2021.

Apple Inc. |\\\\n2022 Form 10-K | 38 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s\\\\nnon-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 87,031\\\\nDue after 5 years through 10 years 16,429 Due after 10 years 17,345 Total fair\\\\nvalue $ 120,805 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use\\\\nderivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign\\\\nexchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge\\\\ncertain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations\\\\nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\\\\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial\\\\nimpact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign\\\\nExchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency\\\\nexchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts\\\\nor other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.\\\\nThe Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\\\\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\\\\n12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or\\\\nmarketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\\\\nthe Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\\\\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or\\\\nfair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over\\\\nwhich the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash\\\\nflows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years. The\\\\nCompany may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as\\\\naccounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\\\\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate\\\\nRisk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from\\\\nfluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate\\\\nswaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments\\\\nas either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the\\\\nCompany’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and\\\\nSeptember 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Derivative\\\\ninstruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n102,670 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 16,875 Derivative\\\\ninstruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n185,381 $ 126,918 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39 The gross fair values of\\\\nthe Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were\\\\nas follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as\\\\nAccounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting\\\\nHedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts\\\\n$ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1)\\\\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are\\\\nincluded in other current assets and other non-current assets in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using\\\\nLevel 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and\\\\nother non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\\\\nderivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all\\\\ncounterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company\\\\ngenerally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\\\\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain\\\\nderivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further\\\\nlimit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting\\\\narrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative\\\\ncontracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a\\\\nsingle net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022,\\\\nthe potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s\\\\nderivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a\\\\nreduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8\\\\nbillion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million. The carrying\\\\namounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24,\\\\n2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Hedged\\\\nassets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 13,378 $\\\\n15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,739 ) $ ( 17,857 ) Accounts\\\\nReceivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables\\\\noutstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\\\\nretailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\\\\nand government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral\\\\nfrom its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-\\\\nparty credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition,\\\\nwhen possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables\\\\nwith credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party\\\\nfinancing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing\\\\narrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the\\\\nend customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or\\\\ncredit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 24,\\\\n2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade\\\\nreceivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers\\\\naccounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022\\\\nand September 25, 2021, respectively.

European Commission State Aid Decision On August\\\\n30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted\\\\nstate aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning\\\\nthe tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the\\\\nCompany (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to\\\\ncalculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June\\\\n2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January\\\\n2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.\\\\nThe recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\\\\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the\\\\nGeneral Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General\\\\nCourt”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.\\\\nOn September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s\\\\ndecision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any\\\\nincremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State\\\\nAid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign\\\\ntax credit limitations in the Act. On an annual basis, the Company may request\\\\napproval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for\\\\ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted\\\\nrecovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery\\\\namount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted\\\\nfrom general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the\\\\n2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and\\\\nare settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-\\\\none basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares\\\\navailable for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs\\\\ngranted.

RSUs\\\\ngranted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for\\\\ngrant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The\\\\nDirector Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\\\\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and\\\\nother terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately\\\\n45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to\\\\nDirector Plan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9,\\\\n2021. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the\\\\n“Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all\\\\nemployees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock\\\\nthrough payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair\\\\nmarket values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month\\\\noffering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are\\\\nlimited to 10% of the employee’s eligible compensation and employees may not\\\\npurchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year.

Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies\\\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally\\\\navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained\\\\nfrom single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used\\\\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are\\\\nat times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing\\\\nfluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly\\\\nused by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often\\\\nutilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until\\\\nthe suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\\\nCompany’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products\\\\nare manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia,\\\\nwith some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional\\\\nPurchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet\\\\ncommitments that require the future purchase of goods or services\\\\n(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase\\\\nobligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet\\\\nservices and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable\\\\nunconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year\\\\nas of September 24, 2022, are as follows (in millions): 2023 $ 13,488 2024\\\\n4,876 2025 1,418 2026 6,780 2027 312 Thereafter 412 Total $ 27,286\\\\nContingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims\\\\nthat have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been\\\\nfully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the\\\\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 49 Report of\\\\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the\\\\nBoard of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have\\\\naudited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements\\\\nof operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for\\\\neach of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the\\\\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\\\\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\\\\nthe financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25,\\\\n2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\\\\nthree years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in conformity with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance\\\\nwith the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\\\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nas of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022\\\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial\\\\nstatements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our\\\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\\\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\\\\nand are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\\\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\\\nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\\\\naudits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\\\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\\\\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\\\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\\\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\\\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\\\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\\\\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\\\\nopinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is\\\\na matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\\\nand that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\\\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\\\nor complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\\\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\\\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\\\\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure\\\\nto which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As\\\\ndiscussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\\\\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\\\\nmany state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total\\\\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0\\\\nbillion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In\\\\naccounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment\\\\nin the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international\\\\ntax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax\\\\nposition is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the\\\\nbenefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant\\\\njudgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested\\\\ncontrols relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\\\\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more\\\\nlikely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit\\\\nof its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To\\\\nevaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than\\\\nnot to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and\\\\nevaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple\\\\nInc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and\\\\ntechnical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject\\\\nmatter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s\\\\ntax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with\\\\nrelated taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received\\\\nexternal legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\\\\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated\\\\nApple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the\\\\nfinancial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s\\\\nauditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 27, 2022 Apple Inc. | 2022\\\\nForm 10-K | 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the\\\\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal\\\\nControl Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria\\\\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\\\n“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\\\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\\\n24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with\\\\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\\\n24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of\\\\noperations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each\\\\nof the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related\\\\nnotes and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\\\\nthereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for\\\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple\\\\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\\\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\\\nindependent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\\\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in\\\\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\\\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\\\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\\\\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\\\\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\\\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 27, 2022\\\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with\\\\nAccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and\\\\nProcedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an\\\\nevaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\\\\nofficer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\\\\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were\\\\neffective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files\\\\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\\\\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\\\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\\\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations\\\\nover Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\\\npurposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\\\n(“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes\\\\nthose policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records\\\\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\\\ndispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\\\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and\\\\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the\\\\nCompany’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive\\\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\\\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\\\\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\\\\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\\\\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\\\\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\\\\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\\\\nevaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all\\\\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any\\\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to\\\\nthe risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes\\\\nin business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\\\\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for\\\\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\\\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management\\\\nconducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,\\\\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting\\\\nwas effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\\\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent\\\\nregistered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit\\\\nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which\\\\nappears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over\\\\nFinancial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were\\\\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph\\\\n(d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially\\\\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\\\\ninternal control over financial reporting.

Payment Services The Company offers payment\\\\nservices, including Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a\\\\ncashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are\\\\nprimarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise\\\\nand government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party\\\\nproducts in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-\\\\nsized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\\\\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also\\\\nemploys a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party\\\\ncellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022,\\\\nthe Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels\\\\naccounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The\\\\nmarkets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and\\\\nare characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,\\\\nshort product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\\\nin product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part\\\\nof consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete\\\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by\\\\nimitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the\\\\ncontinuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\\\\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\\\\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\\\\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive\\\\nfactors important to the Company include price, product and service features\\\\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and\\\\nservice quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party\\\\nsoftware and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability,\\\\nservice and support, and corporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2\\\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to\\\\nsmartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and\\\\nservices. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\\\\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other\\\\nresources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\\\\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\\\\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\\\\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or\\\\nno profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business\\\\nmodels that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to\\\\nobtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces\\\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features\\\\nand applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\\\\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of\\\\nComponents Although most components essential to the Company’s business are\\\\ngenerally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently\\\\nobtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used\\\\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are\\\\nat times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing\\\\nfluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly\\\\nused by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often\\\\nutilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until\\\\nthe suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\\\nCompany’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply\\\\nof many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will\\\\nbe able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by\\\\noutsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac\\\\ncomputers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development\\\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by\\\\nrapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully\\\\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\\\\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\\\nCompany continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and\\\\nservices, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and\\\\ndevelopment (“R&D;”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of\\\\nthird-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company\\\\ncurrently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to\\\\ncertain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services.\\\\nThis includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of\\\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries.\\\\nAlthough the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property\\\\nrights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its\\\\nsuccess does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on\\\\nthe innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its\\\\npersonnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark\\\\napplications to protect innovations arising from its research, development,\\\\ndesign and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications\\\\naround the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of\\\\nissued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single\\\\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual\\\\nproperty rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and\\\\nservices. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the\\\\nCompany’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property\\\\nowned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew\\\\nlicenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and\\\\nservices. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such\\\\nlicenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The\\\\nCompany has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter\\\\ncompared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\\\\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect\\\\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory\\\\nfollowing a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often\\\\ndeclines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be\\\\naffected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\\\nHuman Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated\\\\nteam, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for\\\\nall of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had\\\\napproximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and\\\\nPolicies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion\\\\nand diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or\\\\ndiscrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that\\\\ncompensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees\\\\nto share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most\\\\nlikely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time\\\\nand support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of\\\\nthis, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the\\\\nworld and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support\\\\nemployees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The\\\\nCompany remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive\\\\nworkforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\\\\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an\\\\ninclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\\\\nemployees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication\\\\namong team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative\\\\nwork environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members\\\\nare encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns,\\\\nand the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like\\\\ncareer development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The\\\\nCompany is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates.\\\\nThe Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures\\\\nto mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general\\\\nsafety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\\\\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.\\\\nAdditionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\\\\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company\\\\nhas also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19\\\\npandemic. Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K,\\\\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to\\\\nreports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange\\\\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A.\\\\nRisk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors,\\\\nwhether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any\\\\none or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following\\\\nfactors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of\\\\noperations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be\\\\nconsidered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors\\\\nshould not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future\\\\nperiods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\\\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and\\\\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item\\\\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance\\\\ndepend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse\\\\neconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. The Company has international\\\\noperations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the\\\\nCompany’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is\\\\nlarge and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities,\\\\nincluding manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a\\\\nresult, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on\\\\nglobal and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions,\\\\nincluding inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and\\\\nother barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter\\\\ncredit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can\\\\nadversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\\\naffect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer\\\\nconfidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to\\\\nfinancial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real\\\\nestate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy\\\\nshortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic\\\\nfactors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s\\\\nproducts, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic\\\\nconditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\\\\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers\\\\nand other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability;\\\\ninability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the\\\\nCompany’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment can\\\\nalso lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade\\\\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial\\\\ninstitutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial\\\\ninstruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. The Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\\\nstock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially\\\\nadversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and continues\\\\nto have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\\\\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have\\\\nincluded restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of\\\\nbusinesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic\\\\nhas at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused\\\\nsignificant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have\\\\nadversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component\\\\nsuppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced\\\\ndisruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and\\\\nsimilar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also\\\\nadversely impact consumer demand for the Company’s products and services in\\\\naffected areas. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5 The Company continues to\\\\nmonitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the\\\\nrecommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which\\\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and financial\\\\nperformance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the\\\\nCompany’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of\\\\nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability,\\\\ndistribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of\\\\nprotective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\\\\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional\\\\nfuture impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand\\\\nfor the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales\\\\nand distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic\\\\nplans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect\\\\nof heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of\\\\nthis Form 10-K. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events,\\\\ntrade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters,\\\\npublic health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\\\\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other\\\\nbusiness interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the\\\\nglobal economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and\\\\nits customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The\\\\nCompany has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing\\\\na majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\\\\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of\\\\nthe Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing\\\\npartners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan,\\\\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other\\\\ninternational conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures\\\\nthat restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the\\\\nCompany derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\\\\nsupply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have\\\\nled to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China\\\\nmainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of\\\\nthe Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into\\\\nmaking them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that\\\\nthe Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s\\\\nproducts more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products\\\\nless competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other\\\\nmeasures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data,\\\\nthat could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and\\\\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed.\\\\nThese measures can require the Company to take various actions, including\\\\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer\\\\nthird-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations\\\\nin accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-\\\\nconsuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be\\\\nannounced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to\\\\neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and\\\\nconflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response\\\\ncould be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding\\\\ntrade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on\\\\nconsumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical\\\\nbusiness operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are\\\\nin locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\\\\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of\\\\ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other\\\\nindustrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\\\\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including\\\\npandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s\\\\ncontrol. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural\\\\ndisasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events\\\\ncan make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\\\\nproducts to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s\\\\nsupply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the\\\\nCompany’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the\\\\nCompany can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\\\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the\\\\nCompany relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of\\\\nmany critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would\\\\nexacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form\\\\n10-K | 6 The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial\\\\naccidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s\\\\nsuppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations,\\\\nan industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or\\\\nloss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s\\\\nreputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially\\\\nadversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and\\\\ndemand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\\\\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on\\\\nfreight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions\\\\nin the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting\\\\nin interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production\\\\nramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for\\\\ncertain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover\\\\nall losses that may arise. Global markets for the Company’s products and\\\\nservices are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and\\\\nthe Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The\\\\nCompany’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global\\\\nmarkets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,\\\\nshort product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\\\nin product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part\\\\nof consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully\\\\ndepends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\\\nCompany designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products,\\\\nincluding the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\\\\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments\\\\nin R&D.; There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected\\\\nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\\\\nand services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of\\\\npatents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of\\\\nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing\\\\nand very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and\\\\ninfringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property\\\\nprotection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company\\\\noperates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative\\\\nnew products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the\\\\nCompany’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a\\\\ncompetitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has\\\\na minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet\\\\nmarkets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\\\\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other\\\\nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content\\\\nsupplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have\\\\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\\\\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\\\\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or\\\\nno profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes\\\\nhave from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate\\\\nthe Company’s product features and applications within their products or\\\\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\\\\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as\\\\ncompetitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly\\\\nwithin their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from\\\\ncompanies that have significant resources and experience and have established\\\\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with\\\\nbusiness models that provide content to users for free. The Company also\\\\ncompetes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\\\napplications. The Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve\\\\nits products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.\\\\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide\\\\nproducts and services that compete effectively. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K |\\\\n7 Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the\\\\nCompany must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of\\\\nproducts and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of\\\\nthe markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\\\\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance\\\\nexisting products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new\\\\nand upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to\\\\nthese new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and\\\\nservice introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and\\\\nsuccessful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the\\\\nrisks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of\\\\napplication software for the Company’s products, the effective management of\\\\npurchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product\\\\ndemand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected\\\\ncosts to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services\\\\nmay have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance\\\\nthe Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of\\\\nproducts and services. The Company depends on component and product\\\\nmanufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many\\\\nof which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s\\\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\\\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan\\\\nand Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is\\\\ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single\\\\nlocations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require\\\\nconsiderable time and resources and involve significant risks and\\\\nuncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\\\\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they\\\\nalso reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.\\\\nSuch diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an\\\\nadverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services\\\\nprovided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\\\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions\\\\nfor product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\\\\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the\\\\nevent of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect\\\\nliabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to\\\\nadhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of\\\\nconduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and\\\\nEurope to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners\\\\nprimarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\\\\nCompany’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have\\\\na negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished\\\\ngoods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit\\\\nto final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including\\\\nnatural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,\\\\ncommercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental,\\\\npublic health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The\\\\nCompany has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held\\\\nat certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of\\\\nits suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these\\\\narrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these\\\\noutsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or\\\\nother disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\\\\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or\\\\nprepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain\\\\ncomponents from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that\\\\nare available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\\\nshortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high\\\\ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient\\\\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at\\\\nall. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\\\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or\\\\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may\\\\nsuffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for\\\\nthe supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting\\\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional\\\\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s\\\\noperations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\\\\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\\\n” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components Therefore,\\\\nthe Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\\\\nincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8 The\\\\nCompany’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one\\\\nsource. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity\\\\nconstraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\\\\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of\\\\nreasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of\\\\ncommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing\\\\nproduct has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has\\\\ndelayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely\\\\naffected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect\\\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany’s business and financial performance could also be materially\\\\nadversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\\\\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\\\\nfrom an alternative source. The Company’s products and services may be\\\\naffected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the\\\\nCompany’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software\\\\nproducts and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\\\\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as\\\\nthose offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly\\\\ninterfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products.\\\\nDefects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from\\\\nthird parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and\\\\ncreate a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These\\\\nrisks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\\\\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings\\\\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service\\\\nslowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time\\\\nhave not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.\\\\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all\\\\nissues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure\\\\nto do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting\\\\nthe Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed\\\\nto product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications,\\\\nwrite-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible\\\\nassets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation\\\\ncosts and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the\\\\nexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in\\\\nharm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\\\\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and\\\\nservice introductions and lost sales. The Company is exposed to the risk of\\\\nwrite-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\\\\npurchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for\\\\nproduct and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\\\\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The\\\\nCompany also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess\\\\nproducts and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including\\\\ncapital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments,\\\\nfor impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be\\\\nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it\\\\nrecords a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the\\\\nasset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory,\\\\ncapital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase\\\\ncommitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company\\\\nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the\\\\nrapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in\\\\nwhich the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and\\\\nbuilds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\\\\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component\\\\nand manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because\\\\nthe Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid\\\\ntechnology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\\\\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\\\\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company\\\\nrelies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be\\\\navailable to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The\\\\nCompany’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property\\\\nowned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\\\\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the\\\\nCompany currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive\\\\npatent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\\\\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has\\\\nbeen notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual\\\\nproperty rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\\\\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can\\\\ngenerally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be\\\\nno assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual\\\\nproperty, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or\\\\notherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 The\\\\nCompany’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party\\\\nsoftware developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase\\\\nits hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\\\\nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party\\\\ndevelopers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and\\\\nservices cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products,\\\\ncustomers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes\\\\nthe availability of third-party software applications and services for its\\\\nproducts depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the\\\\nrelative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such\\\\nas Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and\\\\ntablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This\\\\nanalysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company\\\\nand its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications\\\\nand services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone,\\\\npersonal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to\\\\ndevelop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to\\\\ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’\\\\nproducts with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for\\\\nthe Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued\\\\navailability and development of compelling and innovative software\\\\napplications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems\\\\nare subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are\\\\nunable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\\\\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved\\\\ncustomer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in\\\\ndissatisfied customers. The Company distributes third-party applications for\\\\nits products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications,\\\\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company\\\\nonly retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital\\\\nservices or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has\\\\nmade changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\\\\ncompetition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further\\\\nbusiness changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the\\\\nEuropean Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The\\\\nCompany is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App\\\\nStore, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and\\\\nmay in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how\\\\nand to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms\\\\nand manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce\\\\nthe volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales,\\\\nwould decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such\\\\nsales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be\\\\nmaterially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content\\\\nthat appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\\\\ncontracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to\\\\ncustomers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-\\\\nparty content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the\\\\nCompany’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for\\\\nthis content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the\\\\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors\\\\ncurrently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can\\\\ntake actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or\\\\notherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or\\\\ndistributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost\\\\nof, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide\\\\nvariety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage\\\\nrules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly\\\\nto produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\\\\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19\\\\npandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased\\\\ncosts for digital content. Some third-party digital content providers require\\\\nthe Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.\\\\nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new\\\\ntechnology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company\\\\nwill be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in\\\\na timely manner. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10 The Company’s success\\\\ndepends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued\\\\nservice and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel,\\\\nand the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\\\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its\\\\nteam members, the continued availability and service of key personnel,\\\\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled\\\\nemployees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\\\\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\\\\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense\\\\ncompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the\\\\nCompany does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational\\\\nflexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture\\\\nis a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture\\\\nits culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to\\\\nrecruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its\\\\nsuccess, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The\\\\nCompany depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\\\nother resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its\\\\nservices through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\\\nresellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors.\\\\nThe Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party\\\\nproducts in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-\\\\nsized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through\\\\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers\\\\nproviding cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing,\\\\ninstallment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device.\\\\nThere can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same\\\\namounts. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to\\\\nenhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with\\\\nCompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\\\\nThese programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return\\\\nor incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,\\\\nthese resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty\\\\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause\\\\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology\\\\nsystem failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply\\\\nchain are exposed to information technology system failures or network\\\\ndisruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,\\\\ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses,\\\\nphysical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents,\\\\nor other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity\\\\nmeasures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’\\\\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for\\\\nall eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s\\\\nonline services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the\\\\nmanufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or\\\\nreleases of confidential information, including personal information, could\\\\nsubject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and\\\\noperational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store\\\\nconfidential information, including personal information, with respect to the\\\\nCompany’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources\\\\nto network and data security, including through the use of encryption and\\\\nother security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these\\\\nmeasures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access\\\\nto or releases of confidential information occur and could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. The Company’s business also requires it to share\\\\nconfidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company\\\\nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other\\\\nmalicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company\\\\ntakes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or\\\\naccessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are\\\\nnot always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\\\\nconfidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks\\\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results\\\\nof operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11 The\\\\nCompany experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized\\\\naccess to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the\\\\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or\\\\ndisrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the\\\\nCompany’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and\\\\nservices, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial\\\\nrelationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government\\\\ninvestigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against\\\\nthe Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\\\\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and\\\\ntechniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and\\\\nremove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s\\\\nability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition,\\\\nattacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of\\\\nsevere diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to\\\\ngain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a\\\\nrelatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the\\\\nvalue of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\\\nprocesses. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to\\\\nsecure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to\\\\nor loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access,\\\\nincluding through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As\\\\nwith all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all\\\\neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee\\\\nerror, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\\\\nirregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the\\\\nCompany’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names,\\\\npasswords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for\\\\nunauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To\\\\nhelp protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes\\\\navailable technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services\\\\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious\\\\ncircumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of\\\\ncustomer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and\\\\nservices. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to\\\\naddress certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be\\\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the\\\\nCompany’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\\\noperations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the\\\\nfuture may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\\\\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of\\\\nmanagement from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and\\\\nexpenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with\\\\noperating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on\\\\ncapital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and\\\\nsignificant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\\\\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on\\\\na timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could\\\\ndelay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit\\\\nthe Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a\\\\ntransaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be\\\\nsuccessful. The failure of any significant investment could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. The Company’s retail stores have required and will\\\\ncontinue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and\\\\nare subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores\\\\nhave required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,\\\\ninformation systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered\\\\ninto substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been\\\\ndesigned and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness.\\\\nBecause of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores\\\\nrequire substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail\\\\nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail\\\\nstores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual\\\\nstore or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety\\\\nmeasures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant\\\\nlease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements\\\\nand severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many\\\\nfactors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including\\\\nmacro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail\\\\nactivity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs\\\\nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships\\\\nwith existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in\\\\nthe value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail\\\\nlocations at a reasonable cost. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12 Legal and\\\\nRegulatory Compliance Risks The Company’s business, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of\\\\nlegal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to\\\\nvarious claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have\\\\narisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully\\\\nresolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements\\\\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which\\\\ncan subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against\\\\nan indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\\\\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of\\\\nsuch claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\\\\nincreased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and\\\\ncontinues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its\\\\ncellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For\\\\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their\\\\npatents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on\\\\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual\\\\nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in\\\\ncourts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various\\\\ncountries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and\\\\nsubstantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending\\\\nagainst litigation or responding to government investigations can be\\\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In\\\\nrecognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or\\\\nother arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can\\\\nbe no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\\\nlitigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase\\\\nthe Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\\\\nchange its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain\\\\nproducts and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K\\\\nunder the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\\\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and\\\\nContingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of\\\\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may\\\\nhave incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\\\\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently\\\\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or\\\\nan indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above\\\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\\\nFurther, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or\\\\ntrebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\\\\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require\\\\nthe Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability\\\\nto offer certain products and services, all of which could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for\\\\ncertain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover\\\\nall losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to\\\\ncomplex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company\\\\nto potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the\\\\nCompany’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and\\\\nchanging laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data\\\\nsecurity and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\\\\nbilling and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability;\\\\nintellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet,\\\\ntelecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and\\\\ndigital content; availability of third-party software applications and\\\\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade;\\\\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money\\\\nlaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\\\\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13 Compliance with these laws and regulations is\\\\nonerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the\\\\nCompany’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers,\\\\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and\\\\nrequiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and\\\\nchanging laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws\\\\nand regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may\\\\nincrease as the Company’s products and services are introduced into\\\\nspecialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company\\\\nhas implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\\\\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s\\\\nemployees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or\\\\nthe Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have\\\\nviolated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the\\\\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\\\\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating\\\\nto the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs,\\\\npolicies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory\\\\nrequirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will\\\\nbe effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result,\\\\nthe Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either\\\\nof which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\\\nresults of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to\\\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to\\\\npotential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse\\\\neffects on the Company’s business. Many governments, regulators, investors,\\\\nemployees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\\\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses,\\\\nincluding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights,\\\\nand diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements\\\\nabout its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through\\\\nits environmental, social and governance report, its other non-financial\\\\nreports, information provided on its website, press statements and other\\\\ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\\\\nconsiderations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves\\\\nrisks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\\\\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company\\\\ncannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and\\\\ngovernance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree\\\\nwith the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure,\\\\nby the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its\\\\npublic statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental,\\\\nsocial and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied\\\\nstakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory\\\\nproceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is\\\\nsubject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the\\\\nCompany to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and\\\\npenalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store,\\\\nincluding actions taken in response to competition, market and legal\\\\nconditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New\\\\nlegislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws\\\\nin other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could\\\\ninclude how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to\\\\nits platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. The\\\\nCompany is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various\\\\njurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and\\\\nclaims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have\\\\na materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations\\\\nand financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of\\\\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms\\\\nand conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the\\\\nCompany, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required\\\\nto make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App\\\\nStore, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and\\\\nmay in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has\\\\ncommercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that\\\\nare or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved\\\\nagainst those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\\\nFor example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other\\\\ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps,\\\\nand certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government\\\\ninvestigations and legal proceedings. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14 There\\\\ncan be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely\\\\naffected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\\\\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\\\\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and\\\\nregulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively\\\\nimpact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\\\\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products\\\\nand services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of\\\\ncompetitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\\\\nservices, and lost sales. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of\\\\nU.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding\\\\ndata protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international\\\\nlaws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of\\\\nvarious types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not\\\\nonly to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal\\\\ninformation among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several\\\\njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are\\\\nconsidering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending.\\\\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to\\\\njurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\\\\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future\\\\nrequire the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could\\\\nresult in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes\\\\nstatements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its\\\\nprivacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and\\\\nother privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to\\\\ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or\\\\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in\\\\ninquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or\\\\nothers. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing\\\\naudit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks\\\\ngenerally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of\\\\npersonal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations\\\\nrelating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as\\\\nhealth data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data\\\\nare subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification\\\\nrequirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities\\\\nregarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company\\\\nfails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health\\\\ndata or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under\\\\nthe Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the\\\\nCompany can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be\\\\nliable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant\\\\nfees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements.\\\\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is\\\\npotentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated\\\\ninvestigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the\\\\nCompany fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The\\\\nCompany could also experience a significant increase in payment card\\\\ntransaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to\\\\nfollow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition. Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net\\\\nsales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins\\\\nvary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution\\\\nchannels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and\\\\nservices vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross\\\\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of\\\\nfactors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures\\\\nand product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such\\\\npressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively\\\\nstimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product\\\\nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components,\\\\noutside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\\\\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product\\\\nquality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and\\\\nservices, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the\\\\nextent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and\\\\nservice offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other\\\\nmacroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\\\\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and\\\\nother factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results\\\\nof operations and financial condition. The Company has historically\\\\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters\\\\nin its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new\\\\nproduct and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\\\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\\\\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for\\\\nthat product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could\\\\nalso be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\\\\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or\\\\nservice introductions, information technology system failures or network\\\\ndisruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\\\\nor manufacturing partners. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15 The Company’s\\\\nfinancial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value\\\\nof the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary\\\\nexposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S.\\\\ndollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide.\\\\nGross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products\\\\nthat include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially\\\\nadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The\\\\nweakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects\\\\nthe U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and\\\\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing,\\\\npotentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances,\\\\nfor competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise\\\\ninternational pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would\\\\nadversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns\\\\non foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the\\\\nCompany to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\\\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product\\\\ncomponents denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross\\\\nmargins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency\\\\nforward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\\\\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial\\\\neffects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited\\\\ntime the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and\\\\nfluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s\\\\ninvestments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit\\\\ndeterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\\\\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a\\\\nresult, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and\\\\nmarketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.\\\\nTherefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its\\\\ncash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future\\\\nfluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have\\\\na material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts\\\\nreceivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term\\\\nsupply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\\\nconditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its\\\\nservices through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\\\\nand resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to\\\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\\\\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade\\\\nreceivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or\\\\nfinancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network\\\\ncarriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\\\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain\\\\ninternational markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\\\\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from\\\\npurchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\\\nmanufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In\\\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply\\\\nagreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022,\\\\nthe Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\\\\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\\\\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is\\\\nsubject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax\\\\nlegislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject\\\\nto taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland,\\\\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic\\\\nand political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other\\\\nnon-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\\\\nchange. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix\\\\nof earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the\\\\nvaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new\\\\ntaxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S.\\\\nand Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form\\\\n10-K | 16 The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns\\\\nand other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax\\\\nauthorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the\\\\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to\\\\ndetermine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance\\\\nas to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates\\\\nwere to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate\\\\ndetermination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of\\\\namounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and\\\\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The\\\\nprice of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock has\\\\nexperienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so\\\\nin the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the\\\\nstock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock\\\\nprice and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may\\\\nhave been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price\\\\nvolatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its\\\\nstock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time.\\\\nThe Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of\\\\nfuture growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its\\\\nstock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at\\\\ncurrent levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be\\\\nfully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the\\\\nCompany’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does\\\\nnot obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails\\\\nto meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\\\\nrepurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may\\\\ndecline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor\\\\nconfidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.\\\\nItem 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino,\\\\nCalifornia. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities\\\\nand land for corporate functions, R&D;, data centers, retail and other\\\\npurposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the\\\\nU.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are\\\\nused by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are\\\\nsuitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games\\\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\\\\nNorthern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”)\\\\nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws\\\\nand California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of\\\\nits App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On\\\\nSeptember 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of\\\\nthe Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s\\\\nclaim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for\\\\nbreach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain\\\\nprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s\\\\nunfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision.\\\\nThe Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the\\\\nappeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal\\\\nproceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\\\\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during\\\\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have\\\\na material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.\\\\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal\\\\nmatters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts\\\\nabove management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\\\naffected.

This section\\\\nof this Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year\\\\ncomparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year\\\\ncomparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can\\\\nbe found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\\\nResults of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on\\\\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. Fiscal Year Highlights\\\\nFiscal 2022 Highlights Total net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during\\\\n2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone,\\\\nServices and Mac. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\\\\ndollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services\\\\nnet sales during 2022. The Company announces new product, service and software\\\\nofferings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during\\\\nfiscal 2022 included the following: First Quarter 2022: Updated MacBook Pro\\\\n14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and Third\\\\ngeneration of AirPods. Second Quarter 2022: Updated iPhone SE with 5G\\\\ntechnology; All-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;\\\\nAll-new Studio Display™; and Updated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by\\\\nthe Apple M1 chip. Third Quarter 2022: Updated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro\\\\n13”, both powered by the Apple M2 chip; iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and\\\\nwatchOS 9, updates to the Company’s operating systems; and Apple Pay Later, a\\\\nbuy now, pay later service. Fourth Quarter 2022: iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus,\\\\niPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max; Second generation of AirPods Pro; and\\\\nApple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra. In\\\\nApril 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization\\\\nfrom $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22\\\\nto $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased\\\\n$90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents\\\\nof $14.8 billion. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to\\\\nhave, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and\\\\nbusinesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and\\\\nbusiness operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and\\\\nshelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly\\\\ncurtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and\\\\ndisruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures\\\\ntaken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future\\\\nmaterially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\\\\ncondition. Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers\\\\nand logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could\\\\noccur in the future. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 20 Products and Services\\\\nPerformance The following table shows net sales by category for 2022, 2021 and\\\\n2020 (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020 Net sales by\\\\ncategory: iPhone (1) $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 39 % $ 137,781 Mac (1) 40,177 14\\\\n% 35,190 23 % 28,622 iPad (1) 29,292 (8) % 31,862 34 % 23,724 Wearables, Home\\\\nand Accessories (1)(2) 41,241 7 % 38,367 25 % 30,620 Services (3) 78,129 14 %\\\\n68,425 27 % 53,768 Total net sales $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515 (1)\\\\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified\\\\nsoftware upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the\\\\nrespective product.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 21 Segment Operating Performance\\\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The\\\\nCompany’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\\\\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South\\\\nAmerica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East\\\\nand Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest\\\\nof Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\\\\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments\\\\nprovide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one\\\\nis managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\\\\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each\\\\ngeographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable\\\\nsegments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\\\\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and\\\\nGeographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment\\\\nfor 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\\\\nNet sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 23 % $\\\\n124,556 Europe 95,118 7 % 89,307 30 % 68,640 Greater China 74,200 9 % 68,366\\\\n70 % 40,308 Japan 25,977 (9) % 28,482 33 % 21,418 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,375\\\\n11 % 26,356 35 % 19,593 Total net sales $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515\\\\nAmericas Americas net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due\\\\nprimarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the\\\\nU.S. dollar had a net unfavorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales\\\\nduring 2022. Greater China Greater China net sales increased during 2022\\\\ncompared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The\\\\nstrength of the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-\\\\nover-year impact on Greater China net sales during 2022. Japan Japan net sales\\\\ndecreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakness of the yen relative\\\\nto the U.S. dollar. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales\\\\nincreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of\\\\niPhone, Mac and Services.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products\\\\nand Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2022, 2021 and 2020\\\\nwere as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Gross margin: Products $\\\\n114,728 $ 105,126 $ 69,461 Services 56,054 47,710 35,495 Total gross margin $\\\\n170,782 $ 152,836 $ 104,956 Gross margin percentage: Products 36.3 % 35.3 %\\\\n31.5 % Services 71.7 % 69.7 % 66.0 % Total gross margin percentage 43.3 % 41.8\\\\n% 38.2 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin increased during 2022\\\\ncompared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix and higher Products\\\\nvolume, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the\\\\nU.S. dollar. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared\\\\nto 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix, partially offset by the\\\\nweakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross\\\\nMargin Services gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due\\\\nprimarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services gross margin\\\\npercentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to improved\\\\nleverage and a different Services mix, partially offset by the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company’s future gross\\\\nmargins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item\\\\n1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the\\\\nCompany believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and\\\\ndownward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2022, 2021 and\\\\n2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\\\\nResearch and development $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 17 % $ 18,752 Percentage of\\\\ntotal net sales 7 % 6 % 7 % Selling, general and administrative $ 25,094 14 %\\\\n$ 21,973 10 % $ 19,916 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 6 % 7 % Total\\\\noperating expenses $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 13 % $ 38,668 Percentage of total\\\\nnet sales 13 % 12 % 14 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in\\\\nR&D; expense in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related\\\\nexpenses and engineering program costs.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 23 Other\\\\nIncome/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E;”) for 2022, 2021 and\\\\n2020 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\\\\nInterest and dividend income $ 2,825 $ 2,843 $ 3,763 Interest expense (2,931)\\\\n(2,645) (2,873) Other income/(expense), net (228) 60 (87) Total other\\\\nincome/(expense), net $ (334) (229) % $ 258 (68) % $ 803 The decrease in OI&E;\\\\nduring 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to higher realized losses on\\\\ndebt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity securities and\\\\nhigher interest expense, partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains.\\\\nProvision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and\\\\nstatutory federal income tax rate for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows\\\\n(dollars in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 19,300 $\\\\n14,527 $ 9,680 Effective tax rate 16.2 % 13.3 % 14.4 % Statutory federal\\\\nincome tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was\\\\nlower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower\\\\neffective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based\\\\ncompensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D; credit, partially offset\\\\nby state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower\\\\nthan the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective\\\\ntax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and\\\\nforeign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate\\\\nfor 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax\\\\nrate on foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as\\\\na result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\\\nin 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income\\\\ndeductions and share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The\\\\nCompany believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted\\\\nmarketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022,\\\\nalong with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt\\\\nmarkets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital\\\\nreturn program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash\\\\nrequirements include the following contractual obligations. Debt As of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying\\\\nmaturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively\\\\nthe “Notes”), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest\\\\npayments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term\\\\npromissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.\\\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper\\\\noutstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has\\\\nlease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate,\\\\ndata center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the\\\\nCompany had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0\\\\nbillion payable within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24\\\\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing\\\\npartners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\\\\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also\\\\nobtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of\\\\nindividual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build\\\\nproduct based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically\\\\ncovers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had\\\\nmanufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion\\\\npayable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are\\\\nprimarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other\\\\npurchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire\\\\ncapital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and\\\\nnoncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation.\\\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8\\\\nbillion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax\\\\nPayable As of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax\\\\npayable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was\\\\n$22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. In\\\\naddition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital\\\\nreturn program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not\\\\nobligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\\\n24, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The\\\\nCompany intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to\\\\ndeclaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The\\\\npreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with\\\\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s\\\\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results\\\\nrequire the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates\\\\nthat affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\\\\nPolicies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8\\\\nof this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods\\\\nused in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\\\\nassumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\\\\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\\\\nassets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to\\\\nincome taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of\\\\nthe Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the\\\\ninterpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international\\\\ntax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\\\\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes\\\\nthe Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the\\\\nfinal outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is\\\\nreflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\\\\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\\\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\\\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition\\\\nand operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to\\\\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of\\\\nbusiness, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records\\\\na liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount\\\\nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant\\\\njudgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with\\\\nmanagement’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25\\\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest\\\\nRate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its\\\\nforeign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on\\\\na stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency\\\\nand interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s\\\\nrisk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there\\\\ncan be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the\\\\nfinancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or\\\\ninterest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to\\\\nthese instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related\\\\nto the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The\\\\nCompany’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the\\\\nCompany’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is\\\\nexposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by\\\\nfluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the\\\\ninterest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\\\nsecurities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated\\\\nwith hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment\\\\npolicy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting\\\\nthe Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of\\\\ninternal and external management to execute its investment strategy and\\\\nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly\\\\nrated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk\\\\nof principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires\\\\nsecurities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to\\\\nany one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\\\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a\\\\nsensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\\\\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point\\\\nparallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point\\\\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0\\\\nbillion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\\\\nportfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company\\\\nsold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 24, 2022, the Company\\\\nhad outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had\\\\noutstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\\\\naggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively.\\\\nThe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps\\\\nto manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps\\\\nallow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-\\\\nrate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and\\\\nlosses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains\\\\non the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market\\\\ninterest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186\\\\nmillion on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In\\\\ngeneral, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S.\\\\ndollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\\\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\\\\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the\\\\nCompany will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive\\\\npressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\\\\nexchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\\\\ncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange\\\\nrisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly\\\\ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in\\\\nforeign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future\\\\nmay enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt\\\\nissuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign\\\\ncurrency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\\\\nfor up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain\\\\nforeign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting\\\\nconsiderations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\\\\nexposures. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26 To provide an assessment of the\\\\nforeign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis\\\\nusing a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of\\\\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo\\\\nsimulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal\\\\nmarket conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a\\\\ngiven confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative\\\\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to\\\\nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool.\\\\nForecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\\\\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the\\\\nresults of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum\\\\none-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared\\\\nto a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25,\\\\n2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging\\\\npurposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally\\\\noffset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual\\\\nfuture gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio,\\\\ndebt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity\\\\nanalyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations\\\\nassociated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and\\\\npositions.

Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2022 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\\\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and\\\\nPreparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of\\\\nApple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the\\\\n“Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The\\\\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\\\\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\\\\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.\\\\nActual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior\\\\nperiod amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\\\\nhave been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The\\\\nCompany’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last\\\\nSaturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal\\\\nquarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with\\\\ncalendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s\\\\nfiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021\\\\nand 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to\\\\nparticular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal\\\\nyears ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\\\\nthose fiscal years. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the\\\\nsale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes\\\\nrevenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the\\\\nproducts or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally\\\\ntransferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are\\\\ntransferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales,\\\\ncontrol transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net\\\\nsales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for\\\\nProducts and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\\\\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product\\\\nreturns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\\\\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with\\\\nmultiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an\\\\narrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct\\\\nperformance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices\\\\n(“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\\\\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that\\\\nreflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the\\\\nperformance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone\\\\nbasis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices\\\\nconsiders multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and\\\\ncircumstances related to each performance obligation including, where\\\\napplicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends\\\\nin the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and\\\\nthe estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has\\\\nidentified up to three performance obligations regularly included in\\\\narrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software\\\\ndelivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right\\\\nto receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ,\\\\nSiri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a\\\\nwhen-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to\\\\nthe software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any\\\\nrelated discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\\\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered\\\\nperformance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s\\\\nestimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled\\\\nsoftware is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is\\\\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\\\\nthey are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware\\\\nand bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at\\\\nthe time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services\\\\nand unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as\\\\nincurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has\\\\nperformance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these\\\\narrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered\\\\nservices. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates\\\\nentirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company\\\\nhas not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these\\\\nundelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34 For the sale of third-\\\\nparty products where the Company obtains control of the product before\\\\ntransferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the\\\\ngross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including\\\\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory\\\\nrisk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring\\\\nacceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the\\\\nApp Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital\\\\ncontent stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before\\\\ntransferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such\\\\nsales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission\\\\nit retains. The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers\\\\nthat are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes\\\\nrecorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\\\\ngovernment authority. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures\\\\nshare-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common\\\\nstock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis\\\\nfor its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further\\\\ninformation regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,\\\\n“Benefit Plans.” Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation\\\\nof basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in\\\\nmillions and shares in thousands): 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $\\\\n99,803 $ 94,680 $ 57,411 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares\\\\noutstanding 16,215,963 16,701,272 17,352,119 Effect of dilutive securities\\\\n109,856 163,647 176,095 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,325,819 16,864,919\\\\n17,528,214 Basic earnings per share $ 6.15 $ 5.67 $ 3.31 Diluted earnings per\\\\nshare $ 6.11 $ 5.61 $ 3.28 The Company applies the treasury stock method to\\\\ndetermine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Cash\\\\nEquivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with\\\\nmaturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\\\\ncash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have\\\\nbeen classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company\\\\nclassifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term\\\\nbased on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. The Company’s\\\\ninvestments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature\\\\nof the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The\\\\ncost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification\\\\nmethod. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out\\\\nmethod. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35 Restricted Marketable Securities The\\\\nCompany considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or\\\\ngeneral use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable\\\\nsecurities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated\\\\nBalance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\\\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is\\\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\\\\nassets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life\\\\nof the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment,\\\\nincluding manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful\\\\nlife for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use\\\\nsoftware are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\\\\nlives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and\\\\namortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7 billion, $9.5\\\\nbillion and $9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Derivative\\\\nInstruments and Hedging All derivative instruments are recorded in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for\\\\nderivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\\\\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of\\\\ncash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other\\\\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into\\\\nearnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line\\\\nitem in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as\\\\ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge\\\\neffectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the\\\\nhedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the\\\\nhedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the\\\\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive\\\\nincome/(loss) (“OCI”). Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included\\\\nin the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the\\\\nConsolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates\\\\nalong with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the\\\\nhedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value\\\\nhedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment\\\\nof hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net\\\\n(“OI&E;”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the\\\\nfair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\\\\nrecognized in OCI. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of\\\\nderivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are\\\\nrecognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which\\\\nthe derivative instruments relate. The Company presents derivative assets and\\\\nliabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\\\\nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating\\\\nactivities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair Value\\\\nMeasurements The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain\\\\nmarketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for\\\\nidentical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of\\\\nthe Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which\\\\ngenerally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted\\\\nmarket prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\\\\nor corroborated by observable market data. Income Taxes The Company records\\\\ncertain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax\\\\non certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\\\\n(the “Act”). Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease\\\\ncomponents as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center\\\\nand retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease\\\\nliabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental\\\\nborrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot\\\\nbe readily determined. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36 Segment Reporting The\\\\nCompany reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The\\\\nmanagement approach designates the internal reporting used by management for\\\\nmaking decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s\\\\nreportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a\\\\ngeographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,\\\\nEurope, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both\\\\nNorth and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India,\\\\nthe Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries\\\\nnot included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the\\\\nreportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar\\\\nservices, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of\\\\nthe Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market\\\\ndynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various\\\\nsegments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of\\\\nSignificant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its\\\\nreportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for\\\\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales\\\\nthrough the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations.\\\\nOperating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related\\\\ncost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.\\\\nAdvertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which\\\\nthe expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes\\\\nother income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable\\\\nsegments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various\\\\ncorporate expenses such as research and development (“R&D;”), corporate\\\\nmarketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,\\\\nvarious nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and\\\\nadministrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers\\\\nbetween segments for management reporting purposes. Note 2 – Revenue Net sales\\\\ndisaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020\\\\nwere as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 iPhone (1) $ 205,489 $ 191,973 $\\\\n137,781 Mac (1) 40,177 35,190 28,622 iPad (1) 29,292 31,862 23,724 Wearables,\\\\nHome and Accessories (1)(2) 41,241 38,367 30,620 Services (3) 78,129 68,425\\\\n53,768 Total net sales (4) $ 394,328 $ 365,817 $ 274,515 (1) Products net\\\\nsales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software\\\\nupgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective\\\\nproduct. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of\\\\nAirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\\\\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising,\\\\nAppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net\\\\nsales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of certain products.

The\\\\nCompany’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was\\\\ngenerally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment\\\\nInformation and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater\\\\nChina, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net\\\\nsales in 2022 and 2021.

Apple Inc. |\\\\n2022 Form 10-K | 38 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s\\\\nnon-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 87,031\\\\nDue after 5 years through 10 years 16,429 Due after 10 years 17,345 Total fair\\\\nvalue $ 120,805 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use\\\\nderivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign\\\\nexchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge\\\\ncertain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations\\\\nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be\\\\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial\\\\nimpact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign\\\\nExchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency\\\\nexchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts\\\\nor other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.\\\\nThe Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\\\\nexposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\\\\n12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or\\\\nmarketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\\\\nthe Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other\\\\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or\\\\nfair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over\\\\nwhich the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash\\\\nflows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years. The\\\\nCompany may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as\\\\naccounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\\\\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate\\\\nRisk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from\\\\nfluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate\\\\nswaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments\\\\nas either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the\\\\nCompany’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and\\\\nSeptember 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Derivative\\\\ninstruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n102,670 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 16,875 Derivative\\\\ninstruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n185,381 $ 126,918 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39 The gross fair values of\\\\nthe Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were\\\\nas follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as\\\\nAccounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting\\\\nHedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $\\\\n4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts\\\\n$ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1)\\\\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are\\\\nincluded in other current assets and other non-current assets in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using\\\\nLevel 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and\\\\nother non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\\\\nderivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all\\\\ncounterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company\\\\ngenerally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\\\\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain\\\\nderivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further\\\\nlimit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting\\\\narrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative\\\\ncontracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a\\\\nsingle net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022,\\\\nthe potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s\\\\nderivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a\\\\nreduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8\\\\nbillion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million. The carrying\\\\namounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24,\\\\n2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Hedged\\\\nassets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 13,378 $\\\\n15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,739 ) $ ( 17,857 ) Accounts\\\\nReceivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables\\\\noutstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\\\\nretailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\\\\nand government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral\\\\nfrom its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-\\\\nparty credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition,\\\\nwhen possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables\\\\nwith credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party\\\\nfinancing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing\\\\narrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the\\\\nend customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or\\\\ncredit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 24,\\\\n2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade\\\\nreceivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers\\\\naccounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022\\\\nand September 25, 2021, respectively.

European Commission State Aid Decision On August\\\\n30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted\\\\nstate aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning\\\\nthe tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the\\\\nCompany (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to\\\\ncalculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June\\\\n2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January\\\\n2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.\\\\nThe recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\\\\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the\\\\nGeneral Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General\\\\nCourt”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.\\\\nOn September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s\\\\ndecision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any\\\\nincremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State\\\\nAid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign\\\\ntax credit limitations in the Act. On an annual basis, the Company may request\\\\napproval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for\\\\ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted\\\\nrecovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery\\\\namount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted\\\\nfrom general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the\\\\n2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and\\\\nare settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-\\\\none basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares\\\\navailable for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs\\\\ngranted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding\\\\nobligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022\\\\nPlan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares\\\\nwithheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights\\\\n(“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share\\\\nas holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other\\\\nterms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3\\\\nbillion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at\\\\nthe time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022. 2014 Employee Stock Plan The\\\\nApple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-\\\\napproved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees,\\\\nincluding executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of\\\\nsubstantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same\\\\nterms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash\\\\nbonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the\\\\nauthority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K\\\\n| 46 Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee\\\\nDirector Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that\\\\n(i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the\\\\nCompany’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants\\\\nof RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and\\\\nautomatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and\\\\n(iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and\\\\nrelative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award\\\\ngrants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the\\\\nCompany’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits\\\\nset forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs\\\\ngranted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for\\\\ngrant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The\\\\nDirector Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\\\\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and\\\\nother terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately\\\\n45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to\\\\nDirector Plan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9,\\\\n2021. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the\\\\n“Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all\\\\nemployees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock\\\\nthrough payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair\\\\nmarket values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month\\\\noffering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are\\\\nlimited to 10% of the employee’s eligible compensation and employees may not\\\\npurchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. A maximum of\\\\napproximately 230 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance\\\\nunder the Purchase Plan at the time the plan was last amended and restated on\\\\nMarch 10, 2015. 401(k) Plan The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified\\\\ndeferred compensation arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue\\\\nCode. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute a\\\\nportion of their eligible earnings, subject to applicable U.S. Internal\\\\nRevenue Service and plan limits. The Company matches 50% to 100% of each\\\\nemployee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of\\\\n6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.

Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies\\\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally\\\\navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained\\\\nfrom single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used\\\\nby the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are\\\\nat times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing\\\\nfluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly\\\\nused by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often\\\\nutilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until\\\\nthe suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable\\\\nprices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\\\nCompany’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products\\\\nare manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia,\\\\nwith some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional\\\\nPurchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet\\\\ncommitments that require the future purchase of goods or services\\\\n(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase\\\\nobligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet\\\\nservices and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable\\\\nunconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year\\\\nas of September 24, 2022, are as follows (in millions): 2023 $ 13,488 2024\\\\n4,876 2025 1,418 2026 6,780 2027 312 Thereafter 412 Total $ 27,286\\\\nContingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims\\\\nthat have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been\\\\nfully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the\\\\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 49 Report of\\\\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the\\\\nBoard of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have\\\\naudited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of\\\\nSeptember 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements\\\\nof operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for\\\\neach of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the\\\\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\\\\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\\\\nthe financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25,\\\\n2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\\\\nthree years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in conformity with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance\\\\nwith the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\\\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nas of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022\\\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial\\\\nstatements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our\\\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\\\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\\\\nand are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\\\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\\\nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\\\\naudits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\\\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\\\\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\\\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\\\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\\\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\\\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\\\\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\\\\nopinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is\\\\na matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\\\nand that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\\\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\\\nor complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\\\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\\\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\\\\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure\\\\nto which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As\\\\ndiscussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\\\\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\\\\nmany state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total\\\\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0\\\\nbillion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In\\\\naccounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment\\\\nin the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international\\\\ntax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax\\\\nposition is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the\\\\nbenefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant\\\\njudgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested\\\\ncontrols relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\\\\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more\\\\nlikely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit\\\\nof its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To\\\\nevaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than\\\\nnot to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and\\\\nevaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple\\\\nInc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and\\\\ntechnical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject\\\\nmatter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s\\\\ntax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with\\\\nrelated taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received\\\\nexternal legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\\\\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated\\\\nApple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the\\\\nfinancial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s\\\\nauditor since 2009.

Opinion on Internal\\\\nControl Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria\\\\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\\\n“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\\\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\\\n24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with\\\\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\\\n24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of\\\\noperations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each\\\\nof the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related\\\\nnotes and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\\\\nthereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for\\\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple\\\\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\\\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\\\nindependent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\\\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in\\\\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\\\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\\\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\\\\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\\\\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\\\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 27, 2022\\\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with\\\\nAccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and\\\\nProcedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an\\\\nevaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\\\\nofficer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\\\\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were\\\\neffective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files\\\\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\\\\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\\\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\\\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations\\\\nover Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\\\npurposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\\\n(“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes\\\\nthose policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records\\\\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\\\ndispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\\\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and\\\\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the\\\\nCompany’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive\\\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\\\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\\\\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\\\\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\\\\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\\\\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\\\\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\\\\nevaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all\\\\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any\\\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to\\\\nthe risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes\\\\nin business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\\\\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for\\\\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\\\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management\\\\nconducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,\\\\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting\\\\nwas effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\\\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent\\\\nregistered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit\\\\nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which\\\\nappears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over\\\\nFinancial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were\\\\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph\\\\n(d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially\\\\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\\\\ninternal control over financial reporting.

Payment Services The Company offers payment services, including Apple\\\\nCard™, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless payment service.\\\\nMarkets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the\\\\nconsumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government\\\\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in\\\\nmost of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized\\\\nbusinesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its\\\\nretail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs\\\\na variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2020, the\\\\nCompany’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels\\\\naccounted for 34% and 66%, respectively, of total net sales. No single\\\\ncustomer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\\\nCompetition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly\\\\ncompetitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and\\\\nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new\\\\nproducts and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\\\\ncontinual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\\\\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity\\\\non the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors\\\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost\\\\nstructures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\\\nintellectual property. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends\\\\nheavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new\\\\nproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes\\\\nit is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software\\\\napplications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to\\\\nthe Company include price, product and service features (including security\\\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\\\\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories\\\\necosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and\\\\ncorporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused\\\\non expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets and other electronic devices and services. The Company\\\\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have\\\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as\\\\nestablished hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer\\\\nbases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product\\\\nlines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.\\\\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut\\\\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the\\\\nresources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no\\\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models\\\\nthat provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain\\\\nthird-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition\\\\nin these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the\\\\nCompany’s product features and applications within their products, or\\\\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those\\\\nthey currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential\\\\nto the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources,\\\\ncertain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The\\\\nCompany also competes for various components with other participants in the\\\\nmarkets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic\\\\ndevices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that\\\\nare available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some\\\\ncustom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new\\\\nproducts introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available\\\\nfrom only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\\\\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have\\\\nmatured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued\\\\navailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be\\\\naffected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\\\\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\\\ncomponents; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able\\\\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially\\\\nall of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing\\\\npartners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers\\\\nmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the\\\\nindustries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid\\\\ntechnological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends\\\\nheavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive\\\\nproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues\\\\nto develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to\\\\nexpand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D;”),\\\\nlicensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses\\\\nand technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad\\\\ncollection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\\\\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents,\\\\ncopyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of\\\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries.\\\\nAlthough the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property\\\\nrights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend\\\\nin part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative\\\\nskills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The\\\\nCompany regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising\\\\nfrom its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands\\\\nof patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has\\\\naccumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents,\\\\ndesign patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to\\\\ncertain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property\\\\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company\\\\nbelieves the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\\\\nto the expected lives of its products. In addition to Company-owned\\\\nintellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are\\\\ndesigned to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be\\\\nnecessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects\\\\nof the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has\\\\ngenerally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms\\\\nin the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the\\\\nfuture on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 3 Business\\\\nSeasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced\\\\nhigher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal\\\\nyear due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and\\\\nservice introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and\\\\noperating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the\\\\nCompany’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels\\\\nare filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel\\\\ninventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product\\\\napproaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors\\\\nanticipate a product introduction. Employees As of September 26, 2020, the\\\\nCompany had approximately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees. Available\\\\nInformation The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\\\\nForm 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed\\\\npursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\\\\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the Securities and Exchange\\\\nCommission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other information filed by the\\\\nCompany with the SEC are available free of charge at\\\\ninvestor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such\\\\nreports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically provides\\\\nother information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\\\\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press\\\\nreleases and other information about financial performance, information on\\\\ncorporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of\\\\nshareholders.

Further, the\\\\nCompany’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual\\\\nreferences only. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A. Risk Factors The\\\\nfollowing discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\\\nThese risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this\\\\nForm 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part\\\\nII, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\\\nResults of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and\\\\naccompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary\\\\nData” of this Form 10-K. The business, financial condition and operating\\\\nresults of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether\\\\ncurrently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described\\\\nbelow, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the\\\\nCompany’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially\\\\nfrom past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating\\\\nresults. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating\\\\nresults and stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other\\\\nfactors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results,\\\\npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator\\\\nof future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to\\\\nanticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely\\\\naffected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting\\\\ngovernments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such\\\\nmeasures have included restrictions on travel and business operations,\\\\ntemporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.\\\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and\\\\ncaused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have\\\\nadversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced\\\\ndisruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services\\\\nprovided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply\\\\nshortages that affected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic,\\\\nthe Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have\\\\nbeen temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and\\\\npoints of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to\\\\nprotect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers.\\\\nThe Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work\\\\nremotely. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take\\\\nappropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of\\\\nrelevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\\\\non the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain\\\\nand will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including,\\\\nwithout limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the\\\\npandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and\\\\nvaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety\\\\nmeasures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for\\\\nconsumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but\\\\nare not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution\\\\nchannels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the\\\\nCompany’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19\\\\npandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of\\\\nheightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this\\\\nForm 10-K. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\\\ngrowth. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S.\\\\nrepresenting a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a\\\\nmajority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly\\\\nactivities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations\\\\nand performance depend significantly on global and regional economic\\\\nconditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower\\\\ngrowth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade,\\\\nchanges to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates,\\\\nhigh unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect\\\\ndemand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer\\\\nconfidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial\\\\nmarket volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and\\\\nmortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and\\\\nother energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5 In addition to an adverse impact on demand for\\\\nthe Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional\\\\neconomic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s\\\\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\\\\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and\\\\npurchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the\\\\neconomic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility\\\\nrisk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative\\\\ncounterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s\\\\nability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value\\\\nof the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and growth. Global markets for the Company’s products and\\\\nservices are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and\\\\nthe Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The\\\\nCompany’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global\\\\nmarkets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,\\\\nshort product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\\\nin product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part\\\\nof consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully\\\\ndepends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\\\nCompany believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the\\\\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\\\\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company\\\\nmust make significant investments in R&D.; There can be no assurance that\\\\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be\\\\nable to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company\\\\ncurrently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and\\\\nhas registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and\\\\ncopyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete\\\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by\\\\nemulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\\\nEffective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available\\\\nin every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to\\\\ncontinue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins\\\\nor if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the\\\\nCompany’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely\\\\naffected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone,\\\\npersonal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial\\\\ncompetition in these markets from companies that have significant technical,\\\\nmarketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\\\\nsoftware and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the\\\\nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a\\\\nlarger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly\\\\nintense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\\\nmargins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost\\\\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some\\\\nof the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\\\\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the\\\\nCompany faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s\\\\nproduct features and applications within their products or collaborate to\\\\noffer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The\\\\nCompany also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the\\\\nCompany’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings\\\\nor work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services\\\\nalso face substantial competition, including from companies that have\\\\nsignificant resources and experience and have established service offerings\\\\nwith large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that\\\\nprovide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate\\\\nmeans to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the\\\\nCompany’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain\\\\ntheir functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company\\\\nwill be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\\\\neffectively. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6 To remain competitive and\\\\nstimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent\\\\nintroductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly\\\\nvolatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company\\\\ncompetes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and\\\\ntechnologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate\\\\ncustomer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully\\\\nmanage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The\\\\nsuccess of new product and service introductions depends on a number of\\\\nfactors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development,\\\\nmarket acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with\\\\nnew product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application\\\\nsoftware for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments\\\\nand inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability\\\\nof products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\\\\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have\\\\nquality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot\\\\ndetermine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service\\\\nintroductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of\\\\ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes\\\\nits products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\\\nresellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The\\\\nCompany also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of\\\\nits major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and\\\\neducation, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\\\\nstores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network\\\\nservice for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for\\\\nusers’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be\\\\ncontinued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s\\\\nagreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with\\\\nnew carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs\\\\nto enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with\\\\nCompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\\\\nThese programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return\\\\nor incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,\\\\nthese resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty\\\\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause\\\\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its\\\\ninventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\\\\nrisk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories\\\\nthat have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost\\\\nexceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\\\\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews\\\\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities\\\\nand inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\\\\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an\\\\nimpairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\\\\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company\\\\nbelieves its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets\\\\nand purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given\\\\nthat the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other\\\\ncharges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the\\\\nindustries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for\\\\nits products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\\\\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted\\\\ncomponent and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150\\\\ndays. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to\\\\nrapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\\\\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\\\\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Apple Inc. | 2020\\\\nForm 10-K | 7 Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to\\\\nobtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\\\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or\\\\nlimited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing\\\\nrisks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple\\\\nsources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant\\\\ncommodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has\\\\nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no\\\\nassurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\\\\nsimilar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial\\\\nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or\\\\nconsolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s\\\\nability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially\\\\nreasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the\\\\nCompany’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions\\\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations, financial condition and growth, ” above, also could affect the\\\\nCompany’s ability to obtain components Therefore, the Company remains subject\\\\nto significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The\\\\nCompany’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one\\\\nsource. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity\\\\nconstraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\\\\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of\\\\nreasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of\\\\ncommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing\\\\nproduct were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed\\\\nshipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial\\\\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The\\\\nCompany’s business and financial performance could also be materially\\\\nadversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\\\\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\\\\nfrom an alternative source. The Company depends on component and product\\\\nmanufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many\\\\nof which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s\\\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\\\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is\\\\ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single\\\\nlocations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\\\\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they\\\\nalso reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.\\\\nSuch diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity\\\\nof products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\\\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions\\\\nfor product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\\\\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the\\\\nevent of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect\\\\nliability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier\\\\ncode of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could\\\\noccur. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S.,\\\\nAsia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\\\\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\\\\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can\\\\nhave a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or\\\\nfinished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or\\\\ntransit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information\\\\ntechnology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic,\\\\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or\\\\ninternational trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing\\\\nprocess equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\\\\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with\\\\nlong-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply\\\\nof components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers\\\\nexperience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business,\\\\nsuch continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of\\\\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8 The Company’s products and services may be\\\\naffected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the\\\\nCompany’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software\\\\nproducts and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\\\\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as\\\\nthose offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly\\\\ninterfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products.\\\\nDefects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from\\\\nthird parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and\\\\ncreate a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These\\\\nrisks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\\\\napplications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service\\\\nofferings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages,\\\\nservice slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not\\\\nperform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no\\\\nassurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in\\\\nthe hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result\\\\nin widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product\\\\nliability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs\\\\nof inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and\\\\nsignificant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and\\\\nregulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience\\\\nfor users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the\\\\nCompany’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance,\\\\nreduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\\\\nintroductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party\\\\ndigital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially\\\\nreasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties\\\\nto offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell\\\\ncurrently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements\\\\nwith these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee\\\\nthe continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors\\\\ncurrently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can\\\\ntake actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to\\\\nlicense or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content\\\\nowners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to,\\\\nor increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue\\\\nto offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with\\\\nacceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to\\\\nobtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make\\\\nsuch content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material\\\\nadverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide\\\\ndigital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements\\\\nchange, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\\\\nthese solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or\\\\nlicense such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In\\\\naddition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation\\\\nthat would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which\\\\ncould lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could\\\\nnegatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. The\\\\nCompany’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party\\\\nsoftware developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase\\\\nits hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\\\\nsoftware applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party\\\\ndevelopers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and\\\\nservices cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products,\\\\ncustomers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes\\\\nthe availability of third-party software applications and services for its\\\\nproducts depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the\\\\nrelative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such\\\\nas Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers.\\\\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the\\\\nCompany and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated,\\\\nexpected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such\\\\napplications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global\\\\nsmartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less\\\\ninclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more\\\\ninclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for\\\\ncompetitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their\\\\nefforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of\\\\napplications for the Company’s devices may suffer. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K\\\\n| 9 The Company relies on the continued availability and development of\\\\ncompelling and innovative software applications for its products. The\\\\nCompany’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological\\\\nchange, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up\\\\nwith this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of\\\\nthese changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate\\\\ncorrectly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and\\\\ndelivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For\\\\nthe vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they\\\\ngenerate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of\\\\napplications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers\\\\npurchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If\\\\ndevelopers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app\\\\npurchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns\\\\non those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company\\\\nretains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or\\\\neliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be\\\\nmaterially adversely affected. The Company relies on access to third-party\\\\nintellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products and\\\\nservices are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties,\\\\nwhich requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of\\\\ntechnological changes in the industries in which the Company currently\\\\ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and\\\\nthe rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services\\\\nmay unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of\\\\nothers. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be\\\\ninfringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third\\\\nparties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes\\\\nlicenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained\\\\non commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the\\\\nnecessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\\\\nFailure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to\\\\nuse such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could\\\\npreclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise\\\\nhave a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results. The Company’s financial condition and operating results\\\\ncould be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\\\\ngovernment investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal\\\\nproceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary\\\\ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may\\\\narise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company\\\\nsometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to\\\\ncosts and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\\\\nThe number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations\\\\ninvolving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings\\\\nand government investigations, has generally increased over time and may\\\\ncontinue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a\\\\nsignificant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products,\\\\nand new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other\\\\npatent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties\\\\nand often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or\\\\nother violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously\\\\ndefending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as\\\\nwell as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions\\\\nfrequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit\\\\nof particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\\\\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s\\\\noperations and distracting to management. In recognition of these\\\\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to\\\\nsettle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that\\\\nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\\\\nnot occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost\\\\nof sales and operating expenses. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of\\\\nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10,\\\\n“Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the\\\\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property\\\\nrights. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently\\\\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or\\\\nan indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above\\\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating\\\\nresults for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\\\nFurther, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or\\\\ntrebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\\\\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require\\\\nthe Company to change its business practices or limit the Company’s ability to\\\\noffer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely\\\\naffect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company\\\\nmaintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance\\\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that\\\\nmay arise. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10 The Company is subject to complex\\\\nand changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\\\\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the\\\\nCompany’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and\\\\nchanging laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to:\\\\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection;\\\\nadvertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual\\\\nproperty ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet,\\\\ntelecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and\\\\ndigital content; availability of third-party software applications and\\\\nservices; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade;\\\\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money\\\\nlaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\\\\nand safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and\\\\nexpensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations.\\\\nChanges to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\\\\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a\\\\nproduct or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply\\\\nchain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and\\\\nservices less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies\\\\nand procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and\\\\nregulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees,\\\\ncontractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\\\\nCompany’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated\\\\nlaws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nreputation, financial condition and operating results. The technology\\\\nindustry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense\\\\nmedia, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to\\\\ngovernment investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the\\\\nCompany is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around\\\\nthe world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the\\\\nCompany that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially\\\\nadverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. In\\\\naddition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate\\\\ntechnology companies could result in changes to the Company’s business,\\\\nincluding requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings,\\\\nlimiting the Company’s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or\\\\naffecting the Company’s business relationships with other technology\\\\ncompanies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. Further, the Company’s business\\\\npartners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against\\\\nthem, could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners\\\\nand have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will\\\\nnot be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the\\\\noutcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations\\\\nin the future. The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to\\\\nrequire a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject\\\\nto numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required\\\\nsubstantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information\\\\nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into\\\\nsubstantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been\\\\ndesigned and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness.\\\\nBecause of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores\\\\nrequire substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail\\\\nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail\\\\nstores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual\\\\nstore or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety\\\\nmeasures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant\\\\nlease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements\\\\nand severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many\\\\nfactors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic\\\\nfactors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other\\\\nfactors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to: manage\\\\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage\\\\nrelationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with\\\\nfluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in\\\\nquality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business\\\\nstrategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business,\\\\npresent risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nreputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company has\\\\ninvested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or\\\\nacquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties,\\\\nincluding distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-\\\\nexpected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory\\\\nchallenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries,\\\\ninadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible\\\\nassets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky\\\\nand may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating\\\\nresults. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11 The Company’s business and\\\\nreputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or\\\\nnetwork disruptions. The Company is exposed to information technology system\\\\nfailures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power\\\\ndisruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer\\\\nviruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.\\\\nSystem redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or\\\\ninadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery\\\\nplanning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or\\\\ndisruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other\\\\nthings, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with\\\\ncustomer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the\\\\nCompany’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be\\\\nlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information,\\\\nincluding personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company\\\\nto significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information\\\\nincluding, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”)\\\\nwith respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes\\\\nsignificant resources to network and data security, including through the use\\\\nof encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\\\\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or\\\\nunauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and\\\\noperating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share\\\\nconfidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the\\\\nCompany takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to\\\\nthird parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or\\\\nunauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and\\\\noperating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach\\\\nimpacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the\\\\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such\\\\nan incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract\\\\nand retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock\\\\nprice, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to\\\\nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties,\\\\nfines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated\\\\nto gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many\\\\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater\\\\nrisk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the\\\\nconfidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The\\\\nCompany has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its\\\\ninformation technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\\\\nsensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication\\\\ntechnologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\\\\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee\\\\nerror, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\\\\nirregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or\\\\ncustomers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive\\\\ninformation, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information\\\\ntechnology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company\\\\nmonitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts\\\\nunder suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the\\\\ndelay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services. In addition to the risks relating to general\\\\nconfidential information described above, the Company is also subject to\\\\nspecific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health\\\\ndata is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification\\\\nrequirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental\\\\nauthorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the\\\\nCompany fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if\\\\nhealth data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s\\\\nagreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to\\\\nlitigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated\\\\ninvestigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under\\\\npayment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially\\\\ncompromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses\\\\nand could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow\\\\npayment card industry data security standards. The Company could also\\\\nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose\\\\nthe ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card\\\\nindustry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the\\\\nCompany maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain\\\\naspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\\\\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form\\\\n10-K | 12 The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and\\\\ninternational laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data\\\\nprotection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws\\\\nrelating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In\\\\nmany cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also\\\\nmay restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international\\\\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other\\\\njurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws\\\\ncontinue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\\\\nComplying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the\\\\nCompany to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its\\\\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or\\\\nlegal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of\\\\nPII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press\\\\nstatements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements\\\\nor with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data\\\\nprotection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the\\\\nCompany by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational\\\\nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant\\\\nlegal liability. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued\\\\nservice and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future\\\\nsuccess depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel,\\\\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled\\\\nemployees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\\\\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\\\\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business\\\\ncan be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war,\\\\nterrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and\\\\nother business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes,\\\\nwar, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents\\\\nand other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce\\\\nand the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the\\\\nCompany and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics\\\\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\\\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it\\\\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. International trade\\\\ndisputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict\\\\ninternational trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For\\\\nexample, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs\\\\nbeing imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other\\\\nbusiness restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company’s products\\\\nand the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased\\\\ncosts adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its\\\\nproducts. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for\\\\ncustomers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce\\\\nconsumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on\\\\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact\\\\nthe Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to\\\\noffer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the\\\\nCompany to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure\\\\nbusiness relationships, and stop offering third-party applications on its\\\\nplatforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed\\\\ntrade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the\\\\nCompany’s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be\\\\nannounced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to\\\\neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political\\\\nuncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a\\\\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and\\\\nfacilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\\\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and\\\\nother natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are\\\\nsubject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power\\\\nplant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other\\\\nhostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such\\\\nas the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control.\\\\nGlobal climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters\\\\noccurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make\\\\nit difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products\\\\nto its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and\\\\nmanufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s\\\\nservice offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company\\\\ncould require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures\\\\nto resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies\\\\non single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical\\\\ncomponents, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate\\\\nany negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13 The\\\\nCompany’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at\\\\nits suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are\\\\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial\\\\naccident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business\\\\nand harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including\\\\npandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in\\\\nthe future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global\\\\neconomy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public\\\\nsafety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and\\\\nlimitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions;\\\\nand disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution\\\\nchannels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and\\\\ndelays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains\\\\ninsurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\\\\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its\\\\nquarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit\\\\nmargins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and\\\\ndistribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\\\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to\\\\na variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product\\\\npricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to\\\\neffectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services;\\\\ncompressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components,\\\\noutside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\\\\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product\\\\nquality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and\\\\nservices, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in\\\\nforeign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services,\\\\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and\\\\nother factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. The Company has historically\\\\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters\\\\nin its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new\\\\nproduct and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\\\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\\\\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for\\\\nthat product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could\\\\nalso be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\\\\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or\\\\nservice introductions, information technology system failures or network\\\\ndisruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\\\\nor manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.\\\\nThe Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the\\\\npast and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the\\\\ntechnology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme\\\\nstock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways\\\\nthat may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price\\\\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the\\\\nCompany repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in\\\\ntime. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of\\\\nfuture growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price\\\\nshould reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current\\\\nlevels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully\\\\nconsummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s\\\\nBoard of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not\\\\nobligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to\\\\nmeet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\\\\nrepurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline\\\\nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor\\\\nconfidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is\\\\nsubject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\\\\nrelative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales,\\\\ncost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s\\\\nproducts in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained\\\\nfrom foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies\\\\nrelative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\\\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads\\\\nthe Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for\\\\nthe Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\\\\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset\\\\nthe U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar\\\\nvalue of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\\\\nsales. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the\\\\nCompany to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\\\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product\\\\ncomponents denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross\\\\nmargins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency\\\\nforward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\\\\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial\\\\neffects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited\\\\ntime the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and\\\\nfluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s\\\\ninvestments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration,\\\\nfinancial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign\\\\nrisk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and\\\\nliquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-\\\\nmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the\\\\nCompany has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents,\\\\nand marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their\\\\nvalue could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse\\\\nimpact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company\\\\nis exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade\\\\nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this\\\\nrisk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company\\\\ndistributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers,\\\\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products\\\\ndirectly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding\\\\ntrade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or\\\\nfinancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network\\\\ncarriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\\\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain\\\\ninternational markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\\\\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from\\\\npurchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\\\nmanufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In\\\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply\\\\nagreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2020,\\\\nthe Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\\\\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\\\\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be\\\\nsubject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international\\\\ntax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is\\\\nsubject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including\\\\nIreland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to\\\\neconomic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be\\\\nsubject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be\\\\naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing\\\\nstatutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and\\\\nliabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their\\\\ninterpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject\\\\nto the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S.\\\\nInternal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies.\\\\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting\\\\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes.\\\\nThere can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the\\\\nCompany’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or\\\\nIreland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for\\\\nan amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial\\\\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Item\\\\n1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company’s\\\\nheadquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 26, 2020,\\\\nthe Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D;,\\\\ndata centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and\\\\nin various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing\\\\nfacilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in\\\\ngood operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 15 Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is\\\\nsubject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and\\\\nthat have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s material\\\\nlegal proceedings are described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the\\\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and\\\\nContingencies” under the heading “Contingencies.” The outcome of litigation is\\\\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\\\\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period\\\\ncould be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters\\\\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 that did not individually or in the\\\\naggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or\\\\noperating results. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2020 Form 10-K | 16 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,\\\\nRelated Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The\\\\nCompany’s common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the\\\\nsymbol AAPL.

This section of this Form 10-K generally\\\\ndiscusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and\\\\n2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and\\\\n2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s\\\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\\\\nPart II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\\\\nyear ended September 28, 2019. Fiscal Year Highlights COVID-19 Update COVID-19\\\\nhas spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses\\\\nto take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included\\\\nrestrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of\\\\nbusinesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic\\\\nhas significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant\\\\nvolatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic\\\\nand the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected\\\\nand could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price. During 2020,\\\\naspects of the Company’s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19\\\\npandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner\\\\npoints of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of\\\\nthe Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its\\\\noffices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating\\\\nrestrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees\\\\nand customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of\\\\nits offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The\\\\nfull extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s\\\\noperational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend\\\\non many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation,\\\\nthe timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development\\\\nand availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of\\\\nprotective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\\\\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of\\\\nthis Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information. The\\\\nCompany believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and\\\\nmarketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term\\\\nliquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital\\\\nneeds, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments\\\\nand other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.\\\\nFiscal 2020 Highlights Total net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during\\\\n2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of Services and\\\\nWearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an\\\\nunfavorable impact on net sales during 2020. In April 2020, the Company\\\\nannounced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization\\\\nfrom $175 billion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from\\\\n$0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020. During 2020, the Company\\\\nrepurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend\\\\nequivalents of $14.1 billion. On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-\\\\nfor-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All\\\\nshare, RSU and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively\\\\nadjusted to reflect the stock split.

Europe Europe net sales\\\\nincreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of\\\\niPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services. The weakness in foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Europe net\\\\nsales during 2020. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during 2020\\\\ncompared to 2019 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset\\\\nby higher net sales of Services and iPad. The weakness in foreign currencies\\\\nrelative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Greater China net\\\\nsales during 2020. Japan Japan net sales were flat during 2020 compared to\\\\n2019 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, offset by higher net sales of\\\\nServices and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

Products gross margin percentage\\\\ndecreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a different Products mix,\\\\npartially offset by material cost savings and higher leverage. Services Gross\\\\nMargin Services gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due\\\\nprimarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services\\\\ngross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily\\\\nto a different Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher\\\\nServices costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a\\\\nvariety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under\\\\nthe heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general,\\\\ngross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward\\\\npressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were\\\\nas follows (dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Research and\\\\ndevelopment $ 18,752 16 % $ 16,217 14 % $ 14,236 Percentage of total net sales\\\\n7 % 6 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 19,916 9 % $ 18,245 9 % $\\\\n16,705 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 7 % 6 % Total operating expenses $\\\\n38,668 12 % $ 34,462 11 % $ 30,941 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12\\\\n% Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D; expense in 2020\\\\nwas driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company\\\\ncontinues to believe that focused investments in R&D; are critical to its\\\\nfuture growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the\\\\ndevelopment of new and updated products and services that are central to the\\\\nCompany’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The\\\\nyear-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020\\\\nwas driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, higher\\\\nspending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 23 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other\\\\nincome/(expense), net (“OI&E;”) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows\\\\n(dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Interest and dividend\\\\nincome $ 3,763 $ 4,961 $ 5,686 Interest expense (2,873) (3,576) (3,240) Other\\\\nincome/(expense), net (87) 422 (441) Total other income/(expense), net $ 803\\\\n(56) % $ 1,807 (10) % $ 2,005 The year-over-year decrease in OI&E; during 2020\\\\nwas due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain activity on\\\\nnon-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense. The\\\\nweighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash\\\\nequivalents and marketable securities was 1.85% and 2.19% in 2020 and 2019,\\\\nrespectively. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective\\\\ntax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as\\\\nfollows (dollars in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Provision for income taxes $\\\\n9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 Effective tax rate 14.4 % 15.9 % 18.3 % Statutory\\\\nfederal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 24.5 % The Company’s effective tax rate for\\\\nboth 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due\\\\nprimarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of\\\\ntax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s\\\\neffective tax rate for 2020 was lower compared to 2019 due primarily to a one-\\\\ntime adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued\\\\nby the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 in connection with the\\\\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) and higher tax benefits from\\\\nshare-based compensation. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had net\\\\ndeferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax\\\\ncredits of $11.0 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 billion.\\\\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,\\\\nincluding income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning\\\\nstrategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary\\\\ndifferences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The\\\\nCompany will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if\\\\nany, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Recent Accounting\\\\nPronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the Financial Accounting\\\\nStandards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial\\\\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\\\\nFinancial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of\\\\nexpected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will\\\\nadopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified\\\\nretrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s\\\\ninvestment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss\\\\nactivity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not have a material impact on its\\\\nconsolidated financial statements.

As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s quarterly cash\\\\ndividend was $0.205 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on\\\\nan annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual\\\\nObligations The following table presents certain payments due by the Company\\\\nas of September 26, 2020, and includes amounts already recorded on the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, except for manufacturing purchase obligations,\\\\nother purchase obligations and certain lease obligations (in millions):\\\\nPayments due in 2021 Payments due in 2022–2023 Payments due in 2024–2025\\\\nPayments due after 2025 Total Term debt $ 8,750 $ 20,958 $ 21,029 $ 55,341 $\\\\n106,078 Leases 1,622 3,097 2,352 5,888 12,959 Manufacturing purchase\\\\nobligations (1) 47,961 1,849 61 40 49,911 Other purchase obligations 6,178\\\\n2,736 400 90 9,404 Deemed repatriation tax payable 1,533 5,923 12,955 9,254\\\\n29,665 Total $ 66,044 $ 34,563 $ 36,797 $ 70,613 $ 208,017 (1) Represents\\\\namount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements,\\\\nwhich are primarily noncancelable. Leases The Company has lease arrangements\\\\nfor certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate,\\\\nmanufacturing and data center space. The Company’s retail store and other\\\\nfacility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and\\\\ngenerally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual\\\\nobligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as\\\\nof September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company’s\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet\\\\ncommenced as of September 26, 2020. Further information regarding the\\\\nCompany’s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the\\\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.” Manufacturing\\\\nPurchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to\\\\nmanufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final\\\\nassembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire\\\\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the\\\\nCompany, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also\\\\nobtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of\\\\nindividual suppliers. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase\\\\nobligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\\\\nincluding product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and\\\\nnoncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D;, Internet\\\\nand telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26 Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 26,\\\\n2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the\\\\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax\\\\npayable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation\\\\ntax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current\\\\nLiabilities The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily\\\\nconsist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable\\\\nestimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not\\\\nincluded in the above contractual obligations table. Critical Accounting\\\\nPolicies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related\\\\ndisclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\\\n(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition\\\\nand operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments,\\\\nassumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary\\\\nof Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\\\nStatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant\\\\naccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s\\\\nconsolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on\\\\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be\\\\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\\\\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual\\\\nresults may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\\\\nManagement believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates\\\\nare those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related\\\\nassets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees,\\\\nwarranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management\\\\nconsiders these policies critical because they are both important to the\\\\nportrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they\\\\nrequire management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain\\\\nmatters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical\\\\naccounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance\\\\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company\\\\nhas identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in\\\\narrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software\\\\ndelivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right\\\\nto receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud,\\\\nSiri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a\\\\nwhen-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to\\\\nthe software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any\\\\nrelated discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\\\nstand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable\\\\nprices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue\\\\nis based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-\\\\nrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred\\\\nand recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are\\\\nexpected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs\\\\ninvolves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary\\\\nover time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each\\\\ndeliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs\\\\nand the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled\\\\nservices and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of\\\\nthese devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of\\\\nthe product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights\\\\noffered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to\\\\nbe provided. Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of\\\\nInventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company invests in\\\\nmanufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’\\\\nfacilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated\\\\nwith long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also\\\\naccrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory\\\\norders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s\\\\nestimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are\\\\nkey inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets\\\\nand assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee\\\\naccruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand\\\\nfor one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product\\\\ndevelopment plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements\\\\nfor any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record\\\\nwrite-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase\\\\ncommitment cancellation fees. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27 Warranty Costs\\\\nThe Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished\\\\nhardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and\\\\ncustomers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of\\\\nthe Company’s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of\\\\nwarranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical\\\\nand projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim\\\\nand knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical\\\\nexperience. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from\\\\nestimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.\\\\nIncome Taxes The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions\\\\nif it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\\\\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\\\\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such\\\\npositions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-\\\\nthan-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The\\\\ncalculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the\\\\nimpact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws.\\\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\\\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition\\\\nand operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I,\\\\nItem 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II,\\\\nItem 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\\\\nNote 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various\\\\nlegal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.\\\\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been\\\\nincurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which\\\\nrequires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this\\\\nForm 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10,\\\\n“Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the\\\\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more\\\\nlegal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for\\\\namounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\\\naffected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly\\\\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate\\\\nswaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying\\\\nforeign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of\\\\nthe Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the\\\\nexposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a\\\\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign\\\\nexchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses\\\\nrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and\\\\nlosses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\\\nInterest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates\\\\nprimarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While\\\\nthe Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s\\\\ninterest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S.\\\\ninterest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on\\\\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair\\\\nvalue of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and\\\\ninterest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and\\\\nstrategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\\\\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal\\\\nand external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its\\\\ninvestment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\\\\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of\\\\nprincipal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities\\\\nto be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\\\\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\\\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a\\\\nsensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\\\\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point\\\\nparallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point\\\\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1\\\\nbillion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\\\\nportfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company\\\\nsold the investments prior to maturity. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28 As of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding\\\\nfloating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\\\\ncarrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The\\\\nCompany has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to\\\\nmanage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps\\\\nallow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-\\\\nrate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and\\\\nlosses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains\\\\non the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market\\\\ninterest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to increase by $218 million and $325\\\\nmillion on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In\\\\ngeneral, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S.\\\\ndollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\\\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\\\\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the\\\\nCompany will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive\\\\npressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\\\\nexchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\\\\ncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange\\\\nrisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly\\\\ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in\\\\nforeign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future\\\\nmay enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt\\\\nissuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign\\\\ncurrency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\\\\nfor up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain\\\\nforeign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited\\\\nto, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging\\\\nparticular exposures. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk\\\\nassociated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative\\\\npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk\\\\n(“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange\\\\nrates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate\\\\nthousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The\\\\nVAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence\\\\ninterval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to\\\\nadverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual\\\\nlosses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted\\\\ntransactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in\\\\nforeign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the\\\\nmodel, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in\\\\nfair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020, compared to a maximum\\\\none-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because\\\\nthe Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses\\\\nin fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases\\\\nin the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses\\\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative\\\\npositions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting\\\\nthe timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange\\\\nrates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

The preparation of these consolidated financial\\\\nstatements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\\\\naccounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions\\\\nthat affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from\\\\nthose estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial\\\\nstatements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the\\\\ncurrent period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week\\\\nperiod that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years\\\\n2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in\\\\nthe first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s\\\\nfiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to\\\\nparticular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal\\\\nyears ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\\\\nthose fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company\\\\neffected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\\\\n2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU\\\\ninformation has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\\\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the\\\\nfirst quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards\\\\nBoard’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases\\\\n(Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update\\\\nthe guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which\\\\nmodifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and\\\\ncomparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases\\\\nand disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted\\\\nthe new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition\\\\nmethod, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For\\\\ncontracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not\\\\nreassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and\\\\n(iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion\\\\nof right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its\\\\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first\\\\nquarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and\\\\nHedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging\\\\nActivities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value\\\\nhedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments,\\\\neliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness,\\\\nand updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted\\\\nASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon\\\\nadoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in accumulated other\\\\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained\\\\nearnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.\\\\nAdvertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in\\\\nselling, general and administrative expenses. Share-Based Compensation The\\\\nCompany generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price\\\\nof the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on\\\\na straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately\\\\nvest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in\\\\nNote 9, “Benefit Plans.” Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36 Earnings Per Share\\\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per\\\\nshare for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in\\\\nthousands): 2020 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 57,411 $ 55,256 $ 59,531\\\\nDenominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 17,352,119 18,471,336\\\\n19,821,510 Effect of dilutive securities 176,095 124,315 178,925 Weighted-\\\\naverage diluted shares 17,528,214 18,595,651 20,000,435 Basic earnings per\\\\nshare $ 3.31 $ 2.99 $ 3.00 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.28 $ 2.97 $ 2.98 The\\\\nCompany applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of\\\\npotentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing\\\\n62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of\\\\ndiluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been\\\\nantidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid\\\\ninvestments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase\\\\nare classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable\\\\ndebt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale.\\\\nThe Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or\\\\nlong-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.\\\\nUnrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as\\\\navailable-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss)\\\\n(“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are\\\\nclassified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for\\\\nuse in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are\\\\nmeasured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other\\\\nincome/(expense), net (“OI&E;”). The cost of securities sold is determined\\\\nusing the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured\\\\nusing the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment\\\\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line\\\\nbasis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is\\\\nthe lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and\\\\nfive years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and\\\\nmanufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life\\\\nfor leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software\\\\nare amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\\\\nassets, which range from three to seven years. Depreciation and amortization\\\\nexpense on property and equipment was $9.7 billion, $11.3 billion and $9.3\\\\nbillion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-cash investing\\\\nactivities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net\\\\nincrease/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of\\\\n$(2.9) billion and $3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2020 Form 10-K | 37 Non-Marketable Securities The Company has elected to\\\\napply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily\\\\ndeterminable fair values. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity\\\\nsecurities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for\\\\nchanges in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or\\\\nsimilar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable\\\\nequity securities are recognized in OI&E.; Restricted Cash and Restricted\\\\nMarketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to\\\\nbe restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The\\\\nCompany reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance\\\\nSheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the\\\\nexpected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted\\\\nmarketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying\\\\nsecurities. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s money\\\\nmarket funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\\\\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used\\\\nto measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other\\\\nfinancial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit\\\\nratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using\\\\nsignificant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\\\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of\\\\niPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue\\\\nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products\\\\nor services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred\\\\nwhen the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant\\\\nrisks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\\\\ncustomers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers\\\\nwhen products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control\\\\ntransfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\\\\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of\\\\ncontrol or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company\\\\nrecords reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns,\\\\nprice protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s\\\\nexpectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple\\\\nperformance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that\\\\nare distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance\\\\nobligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When\\\\navailable, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When\\\\nobservable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the\\\\nCompany’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\\\\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The\\\\nCompany’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and\\\\ncircumstances related to each performance obligation including, where\\\\napplicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends\\\\nin the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and\\\\nthe estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has\\\\nidentified up to three performance obligations regularly included in\\\\narrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software\\\\ndelivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right\\\\nto receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud,\\\\nSiri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a\\\\nwhen-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to\\\\nthe software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any\\\\nrelated discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\\\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered\\\\nperformance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s\\\\nestimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled\\\\nsoftware is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is\\\\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\\\\nthey are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware\\\\nand bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at\\\\nthe time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services\\\\nand unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as\\\\nincurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has\\\\nperformance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these\\\\narrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered\\\\nservices. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates\\\\nentirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company\\\\nhas not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related\\\\nto these undelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38 For the sale\\\\nof third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product\\\\nbefore transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based\\\\non the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple\\\\nfactors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the\\\\nproduct, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\\\\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\\\napplications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold\\\\nthrough the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not\\\\nobtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\\\\nTherefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing\\\\nin Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected\\\\nto record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to\\\\ngovernmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other\\\\ncurrent liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\\\\nDeferred Revenue Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant\\\\nproducts and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):\\\\n2020 2019 2018 iPhone (1) $ 137,781 $ 142,381 $ 164,888 Mac (1) 28,622 25,740\\\\n25,198 iPad (1) 23,724 21,280 18,380 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\\\\n30,620 24,482 17,381 Services (3) 53,768 46,291 39,748 Total net sales (4) $\\\\n274,515 $ 260,174 $ 265,595 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the\\\\ndeferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories\\\\nnet sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\\\\nHomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3)\\\\nServices net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare,\\\\ndigital content and other services. Services net sales also include\\\\namortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and\\\\nApple TV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\\\n(4) Includes $5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in\\\\ndeferred revenue as of September 28, 2019, $5.9 billion of revenue recognized\\\\nin 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018, and\\\\n$5.8 billion of revenue recognized in 2018 that was included in deferred\\\\nrevenue as of September 30, 2017.

(3) As of September 26, 2020 and\\\\nSeptember 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $18.6 billion and\\\\n$18.9 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to\\\\nthe State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 40 The Company may sell certain of its\\\\nmarketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and\\\\nasset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt\\\\nsecurities generally range from one to five years. The Company typically\\\\ninvests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing\\\\nthe potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy\\\\ngenerally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of\\\\ncredit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each\\\\nindividual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable\\\\ndebt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors\\\\nsuch as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is\\\\nless than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes\\\\nthereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than\\\\nnot be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost\\\\nbasis. As of September 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its\\\\nmarketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-\\\\nMarketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of\\\\ncertain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As\\\\nof September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable\\\\nequity securities had a carrying value of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion,\\\\nrespectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash\\\\nequivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and\\\\nrestricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September\\\\n26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 Cash\\\\nand cash equivalents $ 38,016 $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other\\\\ncurrent assets 36 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets\\\\n1,737 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 39,789 $ 50,224 The\\\\nCompany’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s\\\\niPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use\\\\nderivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and\\\\ninterest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain\\\\nforeign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However,\\\\nthe Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive\\\\neconomic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the\\\\nhedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\\\\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross\\\\nmargins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the\\\\nCompany’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\\\\na portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose\\\\nfunctional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted\\\\ninventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional\\\\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or\\\\nother instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as\\\\ncash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted\\\\nforeign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases,\\\\ntypically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign\\\\noperation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\\\\nmay enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a\\\\nportion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to\\\\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may\\\\nuse non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign\\\\ncurrency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\\\\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments\\\\nas net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign\\\\ncurrency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts,\\\\ncross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a\\\\nportion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in\\\\nfair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or\\\\nfair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt–\\\\nand marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected\\\\nto be recognized within 22 years. The Company may also enter into non-\\\\ndesignated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\\\\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2020 Form 10-K | 41 To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term\\\\ndebt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company\\\\nmay enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These\\\\ninstruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense,\\\\nor changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either\\\\ncash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged\\\\ninterest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.\\\\nCash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment\\\\nof hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is\\\\nrecognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow\\\\nhedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales\\\\nin the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains\\\\nand losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized\\\\nas a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are\\\\nrecognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of\\\\ninterest income or expense are recognized in OI&E; in the same period as the\\\\nrelated income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow\\\\nhedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\\\\nand recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates\\\\non a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value\\\\nof amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized\\\\nin OCI. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-\\\\ndesignated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction\\\\nwill not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent\\\\ntwo-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\\\\nderivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E; in the period of de-\\\\ndesignation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative\\\\ninstruments are reflected in OI&E; unless they are re-designated as hedges of\\\\nother transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that\\\\nare included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a\\\\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward\\\\ncontracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is\\\\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a\\\\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of\\\\namounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in\\\\nOCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts\\\\nthat are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in\\\\nearnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in\\\\nvalue of the hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of\\\\nOperations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value\\\\nhedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge\\\\neffectiveness and recognized in OI&E; on a straight-line basis over the life\\\\nof the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value\\\\nhedges and recognized in OI&E; were gains of $465 million and $777 million for\\\\n2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded\\\\nfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-\\\\nDesignated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\\\\ninstruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial\\\\nstatement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company records all\\\\nderivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s\\\\naccounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge\\\\ndesignation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at\\\\ngross fair value as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in\\\\nmillions): 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair\\\\nValue of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value\\\\nDerivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 749 $ 303 $ 1,052\\\\nInterest rate contracts $ 1,557 $ — $ 1,557 Derivative liabilities (2) :\\\\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1,561 $ 485 $ 2,046 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K |\\\\n42 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value\\\\nof Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative\\\\nassets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate\\\\ncontracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 (1)\\\\nThe fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value\\\\ninputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in\\\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table shows the\\\\nnotional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and\\\\ncredit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative\\\\ninstruments as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions):\\\\n2020 2019 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk\\\\nAmount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts\\\\n$ 57,410 $ 749 $ 61,795 $ 1,798 Interest rate contracts $ 20,700 $ 1,557 $\\\\n31,250 $ 685 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 88,636 $ 303 $ 76,868 $ 323 The notional amounts for outstanding\\\\nderivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume\\\\noutstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to\\\\ncredit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross\\\\nexposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are\\\\noutstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to\\\\nthe terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at\\\\neach respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk\\\\nwill vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table\\\\nabove reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s\\\\nderivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated\\\\nwith the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to\\\\nhedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial\\\\ninstruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,\\\\nwill depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the\\\\ninstruments. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 44 The Company generally enters\\\\ninto master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\\\\npermitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To\\\\nfurther limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral\\\\nsecurity arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted\\\\nwhen the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\\\\ncontractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative\\\\nassets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019,\\\\nthe net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative\\\\ninstruments under its collateral security arrangements was $875 million and\\\\n$1.6 billion, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and\\\\nreceived in other current assets and other current liabilities in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements\\\\nwith the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the\\\\nCompany is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable\\\\nby one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019,\\\\nthe potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s\\\\nderivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a\\\\nreduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.8 billion\\\\nand $2.7 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of\\\\n$312 million and $407 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade\\\\nReceivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with\\\\nits third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers,\\\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\\\\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its\\\\ncustomers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit\\\\nsupport in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible,\\\\nthe Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit\\\\ninsurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans\\\\nor leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are\\\\ndirectly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As\\\\nsuch, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk\\\\nsharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both September 26, 2020\\\\nand September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually\\\\nrepresented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers accounted for 51% of total trade receivables as of September\\\\n28, 2019.

The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax\\\\nrate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed\\\\nrepatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a\\\\nnew minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected\\\\nto record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Provision for Income\\\\nTaxes and Effective Tax Rate The provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and\\\\n2018, consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Federal:\\\\nCurrent $ 6,306 $ 6,384 $ 41,425 Deferred ( 3,619 ) ( 2,939 ) ( 33,819 ) Total\\\\n2,687 3,445 7,606 State: Current 455 475 551 Deferred 21 ( 67 ) 48 Total 476\\\\n408 599 Foreign: Current 3,134 3,962 3,986 Deferred 3,383 2,666 1,181 Total\\\\n6,517 6,628 5,167 Provision for income taxes $ 9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 The\\\\nforeign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of\\\\n$38.1 billion, $44.3 billion and $48.0 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018,\\\\nrespectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 26, 2020, the total amount\\\\nof gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion,\\\\nif recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September\\\\n28, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.6\\\\nbillion, of which $8.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the\\\\nCompany’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross\\\\nunrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2020,\\\\n2019 and 2018, is as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balances\\\\n$ 15,619 $ 9,694 $ 8,407 Increases related to tax positions taken during a\\\\nprior year 454 5,845 2,431 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a\\\\nprior year ( 791 ) ( 686 ) ( 2,212 ) Increases related to tax positions taken\\\\nduring the current year 1,347 1,697 1,824 Decreases related to settlements\\\\nwith taxing authorities ( 85 ) ( 852 ) ( 756 ) Decreases related to expiration\\\\nof the statute of limitations ( 69 ) ( 79 ) — Ending balances $ 16,475 $\\\\n15,619 $ 9,694 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns\\\\nin the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The\\\\nU.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years\\\\n2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years\\\\nafter 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject\\\\nto examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an\\\\nadequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax\\\\nexaminations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with\\\\ncertainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in\\\\na manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to\\\\nadjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\\\\nAlthough the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the\\\\nCompany believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax\\\\nbenefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $3.9 billion.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47 Interest and Penalties European Commission\\\\nState Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its\\\\ndecision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax\\\\nopinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the\\\\nIrish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”).\\\\nThe State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional\\\\ntaxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish\\\\nlegislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application\\\\nof the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated\\\\nto be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland\\\\nappealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice\\\\nof the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General\\\\nCourt annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European\\\\nCommission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of\\\\nJustice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income\\\\ntaxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable\\\\nagainst U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\\\\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister\\\\nfor Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other\\\\ncountries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.9\\\\nbillion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is\\\\nfunded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending\\\\nthe conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs\\\\ngranted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for\\\\ngrant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The\\\\nDirector Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\\\\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and\\\\nother terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are\\\\naccumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest.

The iPhone\\\\nUpgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a\\\\nspecified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are\\\\nmet. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and\\\\nrecognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with\\\\nsubsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\\\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally\\\\navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained\\\\nfrom single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components\\\\nused by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources,\\\\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity\\\\npricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not\\\\ncommonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company\\\\noften utilize custom components available from only one source. When a\\\\ncomponent or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may\\\\nexist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing\\\\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at\\\\nacceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\\\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components\\\\ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into\\\\nagreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no\\\\nguarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\\\\nsimilar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products\\\\nare manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia,\\\\nwith some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2020 Form 10-K | 53 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered\\\\ninto certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of\\\\ngoods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s\\\\nunconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier\\\\narrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property\\\\nlicenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable\\\\nunconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one\\\\nyear as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions): 2021 $ 3,476 2022\\\\n2,885 2023 1,700 2024 357 2025 104 Thereafter 130 Total $ 8,652 Contingencies\\\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have\\\\narisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully\\\\nresolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more\\\\nlegal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for\\\\namounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\\\naffected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable\\\\npossibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss\\\\ngreater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted\\\\nlegal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX,\\\\nInc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of\\\\nthe Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11,\\\\n2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of\\\\n$503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals\\\\nfor the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the U.S. District\\\\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial\\\\nin October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at\\\\nissue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and\\\\nthe PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by\\\\nVirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters\\\\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various\\\\ninternational jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws,\\\\nfraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s\\\\nperformance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems,\\\\nintroduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek\\\\nmonetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S.\\\\nfederal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process\\\\ninto a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\\\nCalifornia (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020,\\\\nthe parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve\\\\nthe U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the\\\\nsettlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily\\\\napproved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $500 million in the\\\\naggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The\\\\nfinal amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of\\\\nconsumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the\\\\nCompany has agreed to pay at least $310 million to settle the claims. In\\\\naddition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental\\\\ninvestigations and requests for information relating to the performance\\\\nmanagement feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not\\\\ndefective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates\\\\n10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience,\\\\nand that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to\\\\ndisclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate\\\\nfor the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority On\\\\nMarch 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its\\\\ndecision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in\\\\nFrance violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion. The\\\\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 54 Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related\\\\nentities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\\\\nDistrict of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s\\\\nproducts infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury\\\\nreturned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $506 million.\\\\nThe Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case\\\\nremains pending. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company\\\\nreports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management\\\\napproach designates the internal reporting used by management for making\\\\ndecisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable\\\\nsegments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.\\\\nThe Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater\\\\nChina, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South\\\\nAmerica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East\\\\nand Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest\\\\nof Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\\\\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments\\\\nprovide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one\\\\nis managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\\\\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each\\\\ngeographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the\\\\nsame as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\\\\nPolicies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments\\\\nbased on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are\\\\ngenerally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s\\\\nretail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each\\\\nsegment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and\\\\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\\\\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are\\\\nincurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense\\\\nand certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded\\\\nfrom segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as\\\\nresearch and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based\\\\ncompensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other\\\\nseparately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not\\\\ninclude intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting\\\\npurposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for\\\\n2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Americas: Net sales $\\\\n124,556 $ 116,914 $ 112,093 Operating income $ 37,722 $ 35,099 $ 34,864\\\\nEurope: Net sales $ 68,640 $ 60,288 $ 62,420 Operating income $ 22,170 $\\\\n19,195 $ 19,955 Greater China: Net sales $ 40,308 $ 43,678 $ 51,942 Operating\\\\nincome $ 15,261 $ 16,232 $ 19,742 Japan: Net sales $ 21,418 $ 21,506 $ 21,733\\\\nOperating income $ 9,279 $ 9,369 $ 9,500 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $\\\\n19,593 $ 17,788 $ 17,407 Operating income $ 6,808 $ 6,055 $ 6,181 Apple Inc. |\\\\n2020 Form 10-K | 55 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income\\\\nto the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as\\\\nfollows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Segment operating income $ 91,240 $\\\\n85,950 $ 90,242 Research and development expense ( 18,752 ) ( 16,217 ) (\\\\n14,236 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 6,200 ) ( 5,803 ) ( 5,108 ) Total\\\\noperating income $ 66,288 $ 63,930 $ 70,898 The U.S. and China were the only\\\\ncountries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2020,\\\\n2019 and 2018. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10%\\\\nof net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and\\\\nlong-lived assets as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as\\\\nfollows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Net sales: U.S. $ 109,197 $ 102,266 $\\\\n98,061 China (1) 40,308 43,678 51,942 Other countries 125,010 114,230 115,592\\\\nTotal net sales $ 274,515 $ 260,174 $ 265,595 2020 2019 Long-lived assets:\\\\nU.S. $ 25,890 $ 24,711 China (1) 7,256 9,064 Other countries 3,620 3,603 Total\\\\nlong-lived assets $ 36,766 $ 37,378 (1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\\\\nLong-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling and\\\\nmanufacturing process equipment and assets related to retail stores and\\\\nrelated infrastructure. Note 12 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements\\\\nfor certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate,\\\\nmanufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original\\\\nterms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options,\\\\nsome of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease\\\\narrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has\\\\nelected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single\\\\nlease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\\\\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and\\\\nvariable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the\\\\nunderlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the\\\\nCompany’s operating leases were $1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associated\\\\nwith variable payments on the Company’s leases were $9.3 billion for 2020.\\\\nRent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease\\\\naccounting standards, was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018,\\\\nrespectively. For 2020, the Company made $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments\\\\nrelated to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained\\\\nin exchange for lease liabilities were $10.5 billion for 2020, including the\\\\nimpact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.

The discount rates\\\\nare generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate,\\\\nas the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily\\\\ndetermined. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $1.7 billion of future\\\\npayments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and\\\\nretail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between\\\\n2021 and 2022, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 20 years.

Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 58 Report\\\\nof Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the\\\\nBoard of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have\\\\naudited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements\\\\nof operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for\\\\neach of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the\\\\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\\\\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\\\\nthe financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2020 and September 28,\\\\n2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\\\\nthree years in the period ended September 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance\\\\nwith the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\\\nStates) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nas of September 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 29, 2020\\\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial\\\\nstatements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our\\\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\\\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\\\\nand are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\\\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\\\nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\\\\naudits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\\\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\\\\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\\\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\\\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\\\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\\\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\\\\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\\\\nopinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is\\\\na matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\\\nand that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\\\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\\\nor complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\\\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\\\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\\\\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure\\\\nto which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As\\\\ndiscussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\\\\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\\\\nmany state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total\\\\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8\\\\nbillion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple\\\\nInc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in\\\\nestimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits\\\\nand complex tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain\\\\ntax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of\\\\nthe benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant\\\\njudgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 59 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested\\\\ncontrols relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\\\\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more\\\\nlikely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit\\\\nof its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To\\\\nevaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than\\\\nnot to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and\\\\nevaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple\\\\nInc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and\\\\ntechnical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject\\\\nmatter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s\\\\ntax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with\\\\nrelated taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received\\\\nexternal legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\\\\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated\\\\nApple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the\\\\nfinancial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s\\\\nauditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 29, 2020 Apple Inc. | 2020\\\\nForm 10-K | 60 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the\\\\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal\\\\nControl Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria\\\\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\\\n“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\\\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\\\n26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with\\\\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\\\n26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of\\\\noperations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each\\\\nof the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the related\\\\nnotes and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion\\\\nthereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for\\\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple\\\\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\\\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\\\nindependent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\\\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in\\\\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\\\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\\\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\\\\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\\\\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\\\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 29, 2020\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with\\\\nAccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and\\\\nProcedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an\\\\nevaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\\\\nofficer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\\\\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were\\\\neffective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files\\\\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\\\\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\\\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\\\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations\\\\nover Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\\\npurposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\\\n(“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes\\\\nthose policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records\\\\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\\\ndispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\\\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and\\\\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the\\\\nCompany’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive\\\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\\\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\\\\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\\\\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\\\\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\\\\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\\\\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\\\\nevaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all\\\\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any\\\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to\\\\nthe risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes\\\\nin business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\\\\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for\\\\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\\\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management\\\\nconducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,\\\\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting\\\\nwas effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\\\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent\\\\nregistered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit\\\\nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which\\\\nappears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over\\\\nFinancial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020, which were\\\\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph\\\\n(d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially\\\\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\\\\ninternal control over financial reporting.

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in\\\\nmost of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized\\\\nbusinesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its\\\\nretail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs\\\\na variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2020, the\\\\nCompany’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels\\\\naccounted for 34% and 66%, respectively, of total net sales. No single\\\\ncustomer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\\\nCompetition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly\\\\ncompetitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and\\\\nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new\\\\nproducts and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\\\\ncontinual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\\\\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity\\\\non the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors\\\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost\\\\nstructures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\\\nintellectual property. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends\\\\nheavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new\\\\nproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes\\\\nit is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software\\\\napplications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to\\\\nthe Company include price, product and service features (including security\\\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\\\\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories\\\\necosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and\\\\ncorporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused\\\\non expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets and other electronic devices and services. The Company\\\\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have\\\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as\\\\nestablished hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer\\\\nbases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product\\\\nlines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.\\\\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut\\\\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the\\\\nresources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no\\\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models\\\\nthat provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain\\\\nthird-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition\\\\nin these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the\\\\nCompany’s product features and applications within their products, or\\\\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those\\\\nthey currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential\\\\nto the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources,\\\\ncertain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The\\\\nCompany also competes for various components with other participants in the\\\\nmarkets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic\\\\ndevices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that\\\\nare available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some\\\\ncustom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new\\\\nproducts introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available\\\\nfrom only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\\\\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have\\\\nmatured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued\\\\navailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be\\\\naffected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\\\\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\\\ncomponents; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able\\\\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially\\\\nall of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing\\\\npartners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers\\\\nmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the\\\\nindustries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid\\\\ntechnological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends\\\\nheavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive\\\\nproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues\\\\nto develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to\\\\nexpand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D;”),\\\\nlicensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses\\\\nand technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad\\\\ncollection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\\\\nhardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents,\\\\ncopyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of\\\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries.\\\\nAlthough the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property\\\\nrights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend\\\\nin part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative\\\\nskills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The\\\\nCompany regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising\\\\nfrom its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands\\\\nof patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has\\\\naccumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents,\\\\ndesign patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to\\\\ncertain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property\\\\nright is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company\\\\nbelieves the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative\\\\nto the expected lives of its products. In addition to Company-owned\\\\nintellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are\\\\ndesigned to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be\\\\nnecessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects\\\\nof the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has\\\\ngenerally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms\\\\nin the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the\\\\nfuture on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 3 Business\\\\nSeasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced\\\\nhigher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal\\\\nyear due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and\\\\nservice introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and\\\\noperating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the\\\\nCompany’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels\\\\nare filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel\\\\ninventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product\\\\napproaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors\\\\nanticipate a product introduction. Employees As of September 26, 2020, the\\\\nCompany had approximately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees. Available\\\\nInformation The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\\\\nForm 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed\\\\npursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\\\\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the Securities and Exchange\\\\nCommission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other information filed by the\\\\nCompany with the SEC are available free of charge at\\\\ninvestor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such\\\\nreports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically provides\\\\nother information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and\\\\nits investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press\\\\nreleases and other information about financial performance, information on\\\\ncorporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of\\\\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this\\\\nForm 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the\\\\nCompany’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual\\\\nreferences only. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A. Risk Factors The\\\\nfollowing discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\\\nThese risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this\\\\nForm 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part\\\\nII, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\\\nResults of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and\\\\naccompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary\\\\nData” of this Form 10-K. The business, financial condition and operating\\\\nresults of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether\\\\ncurrently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described\\\\nbelow, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the\\\\nCompany’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially\\\\nfrom past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating\\\\nresults. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating\\\\nresults and stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other\\\\nfactors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results,\\\\npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator\\\\nof future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to\\\\nanticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely\\\\naffected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting\\\\ngovernments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such\\\\nmeasures have included restrictions on travel and business operations,\\\\ntemporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.\\\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and\\\\ncaused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have\\\\nadversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\\\nprice. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced\\\\ndisruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services\\\\nprovided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply\\\\nshortages that affected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic,\\\\nthe Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have\\\\nbeen temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and\\\\npoints of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to\\\\nprotect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers.\\\\nThe Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work\\\\nremotely. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take\\\\nappropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of\\\\nrelevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\\\\non the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain\\\\nand will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including,\\\\nwithout limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the\\\\npandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and\\\\nvaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety\\\\nmeasures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for\\\\nconsumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but\\\\nare not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution\\\\nchannels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the\\\\nCompany’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19\\\\npandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of\\\\nheightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this\\\\nForm 10-K. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\\\ngrowth. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S.\\\\nrepresenting a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a\\\\nmajority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly\\\\nactivities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations\\\\nand performance depend significantly on global and regional economic\\\\nconditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower\\\\ngrowth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade,\\\\nchanges to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates,\\\\nhigh unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect\\\\ndemand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer\\\\nconfidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial\\\\nmarket volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and\\\\nmortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and\\\\nother energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5 In addition to an adverse impact on demand for\\\\nthe Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional\\\\neconomic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s\\\\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include\\\\nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and\\\\npurchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the\\\\neconomic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility\\\\nrisk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative\\\\ncounterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s\\\\nability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value\\\\nof the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations,\\\\nfinancial condition and growth. Global markets for the Company’s products and\\\\nservices are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and\\\\nthe Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The\\\\nCompany’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global\\\\nmarkets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,\\\\nshort product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\\\nin product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part\\\\nof consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully\\\\ndepends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\\\nCompany believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the\\\\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\\\\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company\\\\nmust make significant investments in R&D.; There can be no assurance that\\\\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be\\\\nable to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company\\\\ncurrently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and\\\\nhas registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and\\\\ncopyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete\\\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by\\\\nemulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\\\nEffective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available\\\\nin every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to\\\\ncontinue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins\\\\nor if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the\\\\nCompany’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely\\\\naffected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone,\\\\npersonal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial\\\\ncompetition in these markets from companies that have significant technical,\\\\nmarketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\\\\nsoftware and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the\\\\nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a\\\\nlarger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly\\\\nintense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\\\nmargins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost\\\\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some\\\\nof the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\\\\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the\\\\nCompany faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s\\\\nproduct features and applications within their products or collaborate to\\\\noffer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The\\\\nCompany also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the\\\\nCompany’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings\\\\nor work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services\\\\nalso face substantial competition, including from companies that have\\\\nsignificant resources and experience and have established service offerings\\\\nwith large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that\\\\nprovide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate\\\\nmeans to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the\\\\nCompany’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain\\\\ntheir functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company\\\\nwill be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\\\\neffectively. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6 To remain competitive and\\\\nstimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent\\\\nintroductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly\\\\nvolatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company\\\\ncompetes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and\\\\ntechnologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate\\\\ncustomer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully\\\\nmanage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The\\\\nsuccess of new product and service introductions depends on a number of\\\\nfactors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development,\\\\nmarket acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with\\\\nnew product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application\\\\nsoftware for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments\\\\nand inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability\\\\nof products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\\\\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have\\\\nquality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot\\\\ndetermine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service\\\\nintroductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of\\\\ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes\\\\nits products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\\\nresellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The\\\\nCompany also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of\\\\nits major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and\\\\neducation, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online\\\\nstores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network\\\\nservice for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for\\\\nusers’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be\\\\ncontinued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s\\\\nagreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with\\\\nnew carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs\\\\nto enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with\\\\nCompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\\\\nThese programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return\\\\nor incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,\\\\nthese resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty\\\\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause\\\\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its\\\\ninventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\\\\nrisk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories\\\\nthat have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost\\\\nexceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\\\\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews\\\\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities\\\\nand inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\\\\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an\\\\nimpairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\\\\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company\\\\nbelieves its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets\\\\nand purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given\\\\nthat the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other\\\\ncharges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the\\\\nindustries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for\\\\nits products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\\\\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted\\\\ncomponent and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150\\\\ndays. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to\\\\nrapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\\\\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\\\\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Apple Inc. | 2020\\\\nForm 10-K | 7 Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to\\\\nobtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\\\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or\\\\nlimited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing\\\\nrisks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple\\\\nsources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant\\\\ncommodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has\\\\nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no\\\\nassurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\\\\nsimilar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial\\\\nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or\\\\nconsolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s\\\\nability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially\\\\nreasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the\\\\nCompany’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions\\\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\\\\noperations, financial condition and growth, ” above, also could affect the\\\\nCompany’s ability to obtain components Therefore, the Company remains subject\\\\nto significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The\\\\nCompany’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one\\\\nsource. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity\\\\nconstraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\\\\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of\\\\nreasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of\\\\ncommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\\\\nrequirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing\\\\nproduct were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed\\\\nshipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial\\\\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The\\\\nCompany’s business and financial performance could also be materially\\\\nadversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\\\\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\\\\nfrom an alternative source. The Company depends on component and product\\\\nmanufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many\\\\nof which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s\\\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\\\nprimarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is\\\\ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single\\\\nlocations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\\\\nlogistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they\\\\nalso reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.\\\\nSuch diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity\\\\nof products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\\\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions\\\\nfor product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\\\\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the\\\\nevent of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect\\\\nliability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier\\\\ncode of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could\\\\noccur. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S.,\\\\nAsia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\\\\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\\\\nthe Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can\\\\nhave a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or\\\\nfinished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or\\\\ntransit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information\\\\ntechnology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic,\\\\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or\\\\ninternational trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing\\\\nprocess equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\\\\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with\\\\nlong-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply\\\\nof components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers\\\\nexperience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business,\\\\nsuch continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of\\\\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8 The Company’s products and services may be\\\\naffected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the\\\\nCompany’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software\\\\nproducts and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\\\\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as\\\\nthose offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly\\\\ninterfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products.\\\\nDefects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from\\\\nthird parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and\\\\ncreate a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These\\\\nrisks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\\\\napplications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service\\\\nofferings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages,\\\\nservice slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not\\\\nperform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no\\\\nassurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in\\\\nthe hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result\\\\nin widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product\\\\nliability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs\\\\nof inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and\\\\nsignificant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and\\\\nregulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience\\\\nfor users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the\\\\nCompany’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance,\\\\nreduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\\\\nintroductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party\\\\ndigital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially\\\\nreasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties\\\\nto offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell\\\\ncurrently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements\\\\nwith these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee\\\\nthe continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable\\\\nterms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors\\\\ncurrently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can\\\\ntake actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to\\\\nlicense or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content\\\\nowners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to,\\\\nor increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue\\\\nto offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with\\\\nacceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to\\\\nobtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make\\\\nsuch content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material\\\\nadverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide\\\\ndigital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements\\\\nchange, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\\\\nthese solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or\\\\nlicense such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In\\\\naddition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation\\\\nthat would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which\\\\ncould lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could\\\\nnegatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. The\\\\nCompany’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party\\\\nsoftware developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase\\\\nits hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\\\\nsoftware applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party\\\\ndevelopers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and\\\\nservices cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products,\\\\ncustomers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes\\\\nthe availability of third-party software applications and services for its\\\\nproducts depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the\\\\nrelative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and\\\\nservices for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such\\\\nas Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers.\\\\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the\\\\nCompany and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated,\\\\nexpected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such\\\\napplications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global\\\\nsmartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less\\\\ninclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more\\\\ninclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for\\\\ncompetitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their\\\\nefforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of\\\\napplications for the Company’s devices may suffer. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K\\\\n| 9 The Company relies on the continued availability and development of\\\\ncompelling and innovative software applications for its products. The\\\\nCompany’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological\\\\nchange, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up\\\\nwith this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of\\\\nthese changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate\\\\ncorrectly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and\\\\ndelivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For\\\\nthe vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they\\\\ngenerate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of\\\\napplications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers\\\\npurchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If\\\\ndevelopers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app\\\\npurchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns\\\\non those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company\\\\nretains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or\\\\neliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be\\\\nmaterially adversely affected. The Company relies on access to third-party\\\\nintellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\\\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products and\\\\nservices are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties,\\\\nwhich requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of\\\\ntechnological changes in the industries in which the Company currently\\\\ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and\\\\nthe rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services\\\\nmay unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of\\\\nothers. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be\\\\ninfringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third\\\\nparties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes\\\\nlicenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained\\\\non commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the\\\\nnecessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\\\\nFailure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to\\\\nuse such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could\\\\npreclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise\\\\nhave a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results. The Company’s financial condition and operating results\\\\ncould be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\\\\ngovernment investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal\\\\nproceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary\\\\ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may\\\\narise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company\\\\nsometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to\\\\ncosts and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\\\\nThe number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations\\\\ninvolving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings\\\\nand government investigations, has generally increased over time and may\\\\ncontinue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a\\\\nsignificant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products,\\\\nand new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other\\\\npatent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties\\\\nand often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or\\\\nother violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously\\\\ndefending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as\\\\nwell as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions\\\\nfrequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit\\\\nof particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\\\\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s\\\\noperations and distracting to management. In recognition of these\\\\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to\\\\nsettle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that\\\\nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\\\\nnot occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost\\\\nof sales and operating expenses. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of\\\\nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10,\\\\n“Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the\\\\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property\\\\nrights. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently\\\\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or\\\\nan indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above\\\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating\\\\nresults for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\\\nFurther, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or\\\\ntrebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\\\\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require\\\\nthe Company to change its business practices or limit the Company’s ability to\\\\noffer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely\\\\naffect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company\\\\nmaintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance\\\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that\\\\nmay arise. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10 The Company is subject to complex\\\\nand changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\\\\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the\\\\nCompany’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and\\\\nchanging laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to:\\\\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection;\\\\nadvertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual\\\\nproperty ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet,\\\\ntelecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and\\\\ndigital content; availability of third-party software applications and\\\\nservices; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade;\\\\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money\\\\nlaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\\\\nand safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and\\\\nexpensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations.\\\\nChanges to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\\\\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a\\\\nproduct or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply\\\\nchain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and\\\\nservices less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies\\\\nand procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and\\\\nregulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees,\\\\ncontractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\\\\nCompany’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated\\\\nlaws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nreputation, financial condition and operating results. The technology\\\\nindustry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense\\\\nmedia, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to\\\\ngovernment investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the\\\\nCompany is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around\\\\nthe world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the\\\\nCompany that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially\\\\nadverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. In\\\\naddition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate\\\\ntechnology companies could result in changes to the Company’s business,\\\\nincluding requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings,\\\\nlimiting the Company’s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or\\\\naffecting the Company’s business relationships with other technology\\\\ncompanies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. Further, the Company’s business\\\\npartners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against\\\\nthem, could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners\\\\nand have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will\\\\nnot be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the\\\\noutcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations\\\\nin the future. The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to\\\\nrequire a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject\\\\nto numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required\\\\nsubstantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information\\\\nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into\\\\nsubstantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been\\\\ndesigned and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness.\\\\nBecause of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores\\\\nrequire substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail\\\\nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail\\\\nstores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual\\\\nstore or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety\\\\nmeasures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant\\\\nlease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements\\\\nand severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many\\\\nfactors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\\\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic\\\\nfactors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other\\\\nfactors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to: manage\\\\ncosts associated with retail store construction and operation; manage\\\\nrelationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with\\\\nfluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in\\\\nquality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business\\\\nstrategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business,\\\\npresent risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s\\\\nreputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company has\\\\ninvested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or\\\\nacquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties,\\\\nincluding distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-\\\\nexpected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory\\\\nchallenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries,\\\\ninadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible\\\\nassets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky\\\\nand may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating\\\\nresults. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11 The Company’s business and\\\\nreputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or\\\\nnetwork disruptions. The Company is exposed to information technology system\\\\nfailures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power\\\\ndisruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer\\\\nviruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.\\\\nSystem redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or\\\\ninadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery\\\\nplanning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or\\\\ndisruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other\\\\nthings, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with\\\\ncustomer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the\\\\nCompany’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be\\\\nlosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information,\\\\nincluding personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company\\\\nto significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information\\\\nincluding, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”)\\\\nwith respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes\\\\nsignificant resources to network and data security, including through the use\\\\nof encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\\\\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or\\\\nunauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and\\\\noperating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share\\\\nconfidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the\\\\nCompany takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to\\\\nthird parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or\\\\nunauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could\\\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and\\\\noperating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach\\\\nimpacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the\\\\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such\\\\nan incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract\\\\nand retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock\\\\nprice, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to\\\\nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties,\\\\nfines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated\\\\nto gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many\\\\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater\\\\nrisk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the\\\\nconfidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The\\\\nCompany has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its\\\\ninformation technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\\\\nsensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication\\\\ntechnologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\\\\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee\\\\nerror, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\\\\nirregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or\\\\ncustomers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive\\\\ninformation, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information\\\\ntechnology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company\\\\nmonitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts\\\\nunder suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the\\\\ndelay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services. In addition to the risks relating to general\\\\nconfidential information described above, the Company is also subject to\\\\nspecific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health\\\\ndata is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification\\\\nrequirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental\\\\nauthorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the\\\\nCompany fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if\\\\nhealth data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s\\\\nagreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to\\\\nlitigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated\\\\ninvestigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under\\\\npayment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially\\\\ncompromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses\\\\nand could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow\\\\npayment card industry data security standards. The Company could also\\\\nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose\\\\nthe ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card\\\\nindustry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the\\\\nCompany’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the\\\\nCompany maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain\\\\naspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\\\\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form\\\\n10-K | 12 The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and\\\\ninternational laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data\\\\nprotection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws\\\\nrelating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In\\\\nmany cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also\\\\nmay restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international\\\\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other\\\\njurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws\\\\ncontinue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\\\\nComplying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the\\\\nCompany to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its\\\\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or\\\\nlegal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of\\\\nPII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press\\\\nstatements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements\\\\nor with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data\\\\nprotection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the\\\\nCompany by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational\\\\nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant\\\\nlegal liability. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued\\\\nservice and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future\\\\nsuccess depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel,\\\\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled\\\\nemployees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\\\\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\\\\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business\\\\ncan be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war,\\\\nterrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and\\\\nother business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes,\\\\nwar, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents\\\\nand other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce\\\\nand the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the\\\\nCompany and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics\\\\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\\\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it\\\\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. International trade\\\\ndisputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict\\\\ninternational trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For\\\\nexample, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs\\\\nbeing imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other\\\\nbusiness restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company’s products\\\\nand the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased\\\\ncosts adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its\\\\nproducts. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for\\\\ncustomers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce\\\\nconsumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on\\\\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact\\\\nthe Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to\\\\noffer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the\\\\nCompany to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure\\\\nbusiness relationships, and stop offering third-party applications on its\\\\nplatforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed\\\\ntrade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the\\\\nCompany’s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be\\\\nannounced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to\\\\neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political\\\\nuncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a\\\\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely\\\\naffect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and\\\\nfacilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\\\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and\\\\nother natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are\\\\nsubject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power\\\\nplant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other\\\\nhostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such\\\\nas the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control.\\\\nGlobal climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters\\\\noccurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make\\\\nit difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products\\\\nto its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and\\\\nmanufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s\\\\nservice offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company\\\\ncould require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures\\\\nto resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies\\\\non single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical\\\\ncomponents, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate\\\\nany negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13 The\\\\nCompany’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at\\\\nits suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are\\\\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial\\\\naccident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business\\\\nand harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including\\\\npandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in\\\\nthe future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global\\\\neconomy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public\\\\nsafety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and\\\\nlimitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions;\\\\nand disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution\\\\nchannels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and\\\\ndelays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains\\\\ninsurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\\\\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its\\\\nquarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit\\\\nmargins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and\\\\ndistribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s\\\\nproducts and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\\\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to\\\\na variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product\\\\npricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to\\\\neffectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services;\\\\ncompressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components,\\\\noutside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\\\\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product\\\\nquality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and\\\\nservices, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in\\\\nforeign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services,\\\\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and\\\\nother factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s\\\\nfinancial condition and operating results. The Company has historically\\\\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters\\\\nin its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new\\\\nproduct and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\\\\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\\\\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for\\\\nthat product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could\\\\nalso be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\\\\ndemand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or\\\\nservice introductions, information technology system failures or network\\\\ndisruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\\\\nor manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.\\\\nThe Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the\\\\npast and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the\\\\ntechnology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme\\\\nstock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways\\\\nthat may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price\\\\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the\\\\nCompany repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in\\\\ntime. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of\\\\nfuture growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price\\\\nshould reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current\\\\nlevels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully\\\\nconsummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s\\\\nBoard of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not\\\\nobligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to\\\\nmeet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\\\\nrepurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline\\\\nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor\\\\nconfidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is\\\\nsubject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\\\\nrelative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales,\\\\ncost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s\\\\nproducts in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained\\\\nfrom foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies\\\\nrelative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\\\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads\\\\nthe Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for\\\\nthe Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\\\\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset\\\\nthe U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar\\\\nvalue of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated\\\\nsales. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the\\\\nCompany to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign\\\\ncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\\\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product\\\\ncomponents denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross\\\\nmargins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency\\\\nforward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be\\\\neffective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial\\\\neffects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited\\\\ntime the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and\\\\nfluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s\\\\ninvestments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration,\\\\nfinancial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign\\\\nrisk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and\\\\nliquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-\\\\nmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the\\\\nCompany has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents,\\\\nand marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their\\\\nvalue could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse\\\\nimpact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company\\\\nis exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade\\\\nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this\\\\nrisk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company\\\\ndistributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers,\\\\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products\\\\ndirectly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding\\\\ntrade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or\\\\nfinancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the\\\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network\\\\ncarriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\\\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain\\\\ninternational markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\\\\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from\\\\npurchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\\\nmanufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In\\\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply\\\\nagreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2020,\\\\nthe Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\\\\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\\\\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be\\\\nsubject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international\\\\ntax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is\\\\nsubject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including\\\\nIreland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to\\\\neconomic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be\\\\nsubject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be\\\\naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing\\\\nstatutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and\\\\nliabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their\\\\ninterpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject\\\\nto the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S.\\\\nInternal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies.\\\\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting\\\\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes.\\\\nThere can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the\\\\nCompany’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or\\\\nIreland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for\\\\nan amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial\\\\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.

This section of this Form 10-K generally\\\\ndiscusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and\\\\n2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and\\\\n2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s\\\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\\\\nPart II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\\\\nyear ended September 28, 2019. Fiscal Year Highlights COVID-19 Update COVID-19\\\\nhas spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses\\\\nto take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included\\\\nrestrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of\\\\nbusinesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic\\\\nhas significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant\\\\nvolatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic\\\\nand the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected\\\\nand could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business,\\\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price. During 2020,\\\\naspects of the Company’s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19\\\\npandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner\\\\npoints of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of\\\\nthe Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its\\\\noffices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating\\\\nrestrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees\\\\nand customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of\\\\nits offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The\\\\nfull extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s\\\\noperational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend\\\\non many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation,\\\\nthe timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development\\\\nand availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of\\\\nprotective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\\\\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of\\\\nthis Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information. The\\\\nCompany believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and\\\\nmarketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term\\\\nliquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital\\\\nneeds, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments\\\\nand other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.\\\\nFiscal 2020 Highlights Total net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during\\\\n2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of Services and\\\\nWearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an\\\\nunfavorable impact on net sales during 2020. In April 2020, the Company\\\\nannounced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization\\\\nfrom $175 billion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from\\\\n$0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020. During 2020, the Company\\\\nrepurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend\\\\nequivalents of $14.1 billion. On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-\\\\nfor-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All\\\\nshare, RSU and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively\\\\nadjusted to reflect the stock split.

Europe Europe net sales\\\\nincreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of\\\\niPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services. The weakness in foreign\\\\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Europe net\\\\nsales during 2020. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during 2020\\\\ncompared to 2019 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset\\\\nby higher net sales of Services and iPad. The weakness in foreign currencies\\\\nrelative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Greater China net\\\\nsales during 2020. Japan Japan net sales were flat during 2020 compared to\\\\n2019 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, offset by higher net sales of\\\\nServices and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during\\\\n2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of Wearables, Home and\\\\nAccessories, Services and iPhone.

Products gross margin percentage\\\\ndecreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the weakness in\\\\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a different Products mix,\\\\npartially offset by material cost savings and higher leverage. Services Gross\\\\nMargin Services gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due\\\\nprimarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services\\\\ngross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily\\\\nto a different Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher\\\\nServices costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a\\\\nvariety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under\\\\nthe heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general,\\\\ngross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward\\\\npressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were\\\\nas follows (dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Research and\\\\ndevelopment $ 18,752 16 % $ 16,217 14 % $ 14,236 Percentage of total net sales\\\\n7 % 6 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 19,916 9 % $ 18,245 9 % $\\\\n16,705 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 7 % 6 % Total operating expenses $\\\\n38,668 12 % $ 34,462 11 % $ 30,941 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12\\\\n% Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D; expense in 2020\\\\nwas driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company\\\\ncontinues to believe that focused investments in R&D; are critical to its\\\\nfuture growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the\\\\ndevelopment of new and updated products and services that are central to the\\\\nCompany’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The\\\\nyear-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020\\\\nwas driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, higher\\\\nspending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 23 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other\\\\nincome/(expense), net (“OI&E;”) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows\\\\n(dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Interest and dividend\\\\nincome $ 3,763 $ 4,961 $ 5,686 Interest expense (2,873) (3,576) (3,240) Other\\\\nincome/(expense), net (87) 422 (441) Total other income/(expense), net $ 803\\\\n(56) % $ 1,807 (10) % $ 2,005 The year-over-year decrease in OI&E; during 2020\\\\nwas due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain activity on\\\\nnon-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense. The\\\\nweighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash\\\\nequivalents and marketable securities was 1.85% and 2.19% in 2020 and 2019,\\\\nrespectively. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective\\\\ntax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as\\\\nfollows (dollars in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Provision for income taxes $\\\\n9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 Effective tax rate 14.4 % 15.9 % 18.3 % Statutory\\\\nfederal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 24.5 % The Company’s effective tax rate for\\\\nboth 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due\\\\nprimarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of\\\\ntax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s\\\\neffective tax rate for 2020 was lower compared to 2019 due primarily to a one-\\\\ntime adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued\\\\nby the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 in connection with the\\\\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) and higher tax benefits from\\\\nshare-based compensation. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had net\\\\ndeferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax\\\\ncredits of $11.0 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 billion.\\\\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,\\\\nincluding income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning\\\\nstrategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary\\\\ndifferences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The\\\\nCompany will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if\\\\nany, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Recent Accounting\\\\nPronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the Financial Accounting\\\\nStandards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial\\\\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\\\\nFinancial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of\\\\nexpected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will\\\\nadopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified\\\\nretrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s\\\\ninvestment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss\\\\nactivity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not have a material impact on its\\\\nconsolidated financial statements.

Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during\\\\n2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable\\\\nsecurities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion, partially offset by cash used\\\\nto acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion. Cash used in\\\\nfinancing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash\\\\nused to repurchase common stock of $66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends\\\\nand dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt of\\\\n$8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion, partially\\\\noffset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion. Debt\\\\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”)\\\\npursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from\\\\nthe commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including\\\\ndividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had\\\\n$5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest\\\\nrate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months. The Company may\\\\nenter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a\\\\npromise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount as an\\\\nadditional short-term liquidity arrangement. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 25\\\\nAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate\\\\nnotes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.1\\\\nbillion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2020, the Company issued $16.1\\\\nbillion and repaid or redeemed $12.6 billion of Notes. The Company has\\\\nentered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage\\\\ninterest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in\\\\nthe future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency\\\\nrisk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances\\\\nand related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\\\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial\\\\nInstruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program As of September 26,\\\\n2020, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $225 billion of the\\\\nCompany’s common stock under a share repurchase program, of which $168.6\\\\nbillion had been utilized. During 2020, the Company repurchased 917 million\\\\nshares of its common stock for $72.5 billion, including 141 million shares\\\\ndelivered under a $10.0 billion November 2019 ASR and 64 million shares\\\\ndelivered under a $6.0 billion May 2020 ASR. The Company’s share repurchase\\\\nprogram does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under\\\\nthis program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open\\\\nmarket transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under\\\\nthe Exchange Act. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s quarterly cash\\\\ndividend was $0.205 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on\\\\nan annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual\\\\nObligations The following table presents certain payments due by the Company\\\\nas of September 26, 2020, and includes amounts already recorded on the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, except for manufacturing purchase obligations,\\\\nother purchase obligations and certain lease obligations (in millions):\\\\nPayments due in 2021 Payments due in 2022–2023 Payments due in 2024–2025\\\\nPayments due after 2025 Total Term debt $ 8,750 $ 20,958 $ 21,029 $ 55,341 $\\\\n106,078 Leases 1,622 3,097 2,352 5,888 12,959 Manufacturing purchase\\\\nobligations (1) 47,961 1,849 61 40 49,911 Other purchase obligations 6,178\\\\n2,736 400 90 9,404 Deemed repatriation tax payable 1,533 5,923 12,955 9,254\\\\n29,665 Total $ 66,044 $ 34,563 $ 36,797 $ 70,613 $ 208,017 (1) Represents\\\\namount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements,\\\\nwhich are primarily noncancelable. Leases The Company has lease arrangements\\\\nfor certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate,\\\\nmanufacturing and data center space. The Company’s retail store and other\\\\nfacility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and\\\\ngenerally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual\\\\nobligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as\\\\nof September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company’s\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet\\\\ncommenced as of September 26, 2020. Further information regarding the\\\\nCompany’s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the\\\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.” Manufacturing\\\\nPurchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to\\\\nmanufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final\\\\nassembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire\\\\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the\\\\nCompany, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also\\\\nobtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of\\\\nindividual suppliers. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase\\\\nobligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\\\\nincluding product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and\\\\nnoncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D;, Internet\\\\nand telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26 Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 26,\\\\n2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the\\\\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax\\\\npayable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation\\\\ntax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current\\\\nLiabilities The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily\\\\nconsist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable\\\\nestimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not\\\\nincluded in the above contractual obligations table. Critical Accounting\\\\nPolicies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related\\\\ndisclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\\\n(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition\\\\nand operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments,\\\\nassumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary\\\\nof Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\\\nStatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant\\\\naccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s\\\\nconsolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on\\\\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be\\\\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\\\\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual\\\\nresults may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\\\\nManagement believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates\\\\nare those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related\\\\nassets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees,\\\\nwarranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management\\\\nconsiders these policies critical because they are both important to the\\\\nportrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they\\\\nrequire management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain\\\\nmatters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical\\\\naccounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance\\\\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company\\\\nhas identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in\\\\narrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software\\\\ndelivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right\\\\nto receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud,\\\\nSiri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a\\\\nwhen-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to\\\\nthe software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any\\\\nrelated discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\\\nstand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable\\\\nprices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue\\\\nis based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-\\\\nrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred\\\\nand recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are\\\\nexpected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs\\\\ninvolves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary\\\\nover time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each\\\\ndeliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs\\\\nand the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled\\\\nservices and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of\\\\nthese devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of\\\\nthe product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights\\\\noffered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to\\\\nbe provided. Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of\\\\nInventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company invests in\\\\nmanufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’\\\\nfacilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated\\\\nwith long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also\\\\naccrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory\\\\norders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s\\\\nestimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are\\\\nkey inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets\\\\nand assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee\\\\naccruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand\\\\nfor one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product\\\\ndevelopment plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements\\\\nfor any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record\\\\nwrite-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase\\\\ncommitment cancellation fees. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27 Warranty Costs\\\\nThe Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished\\\\nhardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and\\\\ncustomers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of\\\\nthe Company’s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of\\\\nwarranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical\\\\nand projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim\\\\nand knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical\\\\nexperience. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from\\\\nestimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.\\\\nIncome Taxes The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions\\\\nif it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\\\\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\\\\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such\\\\npositions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-\\\\nthan-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The\\\\ncalculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the\\\\nimpact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws.\\\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\\\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition\\\\nand operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I,\\\\nItem 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II,\\\\nItem 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\\\\nNote 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various\\\\nlegal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.\\\\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been\\\\nincurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which\\\\nrequires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this\\\\nForm 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10,\\\\n“Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the\\\\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\\\nCompany may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a\\\\nrecorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\\\nclaims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more\\\\nlegal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for\\\\namounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\\\naffected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly\\\\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate\\\\nswaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying\\\\nforeign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of\\\\nthe Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the\\\\nexposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a\\\\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign\\\\nexchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses\\\\nrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and\\\\nlosses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may\\\\nadversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\\\nInterest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates\\\\nprimarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While\\\\nthe Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s\\\\ninterest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S.\\\\ninterest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on\\\\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair\\\\nvalue of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and\\\\ninterest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and\\\\nstrategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the\\\\nCompany’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal\\\\nand external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its\\\\ninvestment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated\\\\nsecurities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of\\\\nprincipal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities\\\\nto be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\\\\nissuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\\\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a\\\\nsensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would\\\\nhave on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point\\\\nparallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point\\\\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1\\\\nbillion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\\\\nportfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company\\\\nsold the investments prior to maturity. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28 As of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding\\\\nfloating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\\\\ncarrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The\\\\nCompany has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to\\\\nmanage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps\\\\nallow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-\\\\nrate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and\\\\nlosses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains\\\\non the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market\\\\ninterest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to increase by $218 million and $325\\\\nmillion on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In\\\\ngeneral, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S.\\\\ndollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\\\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net\\\\nsales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the\\\\nCompany will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive\\\\npressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\\\\nexchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\\\\ncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange\\\\nrisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly\\\\ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in\\\\nforeign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future\\\\nmay enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt\\\\nissuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign\\\\ncurrency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\\\\nfor up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain\\\\nforeign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited\\\\nto, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging\\\\nparticular exposures. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk\\\\nassociated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative\\\\npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk\\\\n(“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange\\\\nrates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate\\\\nthousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The\\\\nVAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence\\\\ninterval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to\\\\nadverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual\\\\nlosses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted\\\\ntransactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in\\\\nforeign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the\\\\nmodel, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in\\\\nfair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020, compared to a maximum\\\\none-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because\\\\nthe Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses\\\\nin fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases\\\\nin the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses\\\\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative\\\\npositions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of\\\\nSeptember 26, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting\\\\nthe timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange\\\\nrates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 35 Apple Inc.\\\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant\\\\nAccounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated\\\\nfinancial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned\\\\nsubsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts\\\\nand transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments,\\\\nwhich are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial\\\\nstatement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial\\\\nstatements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\\\\naccounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions\\\\nthat affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from\\\\nthose estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial\\\\nstatements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the\\\\ncurrent period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week\\\\nperiod that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years\\\\n2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in\\\\nthe first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s\\\\nfiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to\\\\nparticular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal\\\\nyears ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of\\\\nthose fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company\\\\neffected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24,\\\\n2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU\\\\ninformation has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\\\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the\\\\nfirst quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards\\\\nBoard’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases\\\\n(Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update\\\\nthe guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which\\\\nmodifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and\\\\ncomparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases\\\\nand disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted\\\\nthe new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition\\\\nmethod, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For\\\\ncontracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not\\\\nreassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and\\\\n(iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion\\\\nof right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its\\\\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first\\\\nquarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and\\\\nHedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging\\\\nActivities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value\\\\nhedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments,\\\\neliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness,\\\\nand updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted\\\\nASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon\\\\nadoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in accumulated other\\\\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained\\\\nearnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.\\\\nAdvertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in\\\\nselling, general and administrative expenses. Share-Based Compensation The\\\\nCompany generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price\\\\nof the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on\\\\na straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately\\\\nvest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in\\\\nNote 9, “Benefit Plans.” Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36 Earnings Per Share\\\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per\\\\nshare for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in\\\\nthousands): 2020 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 57,411 $ 55,256 $ 59,531\\\\nDenominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 17,352,119 18,471,336\\\\n19,821,510 Effect of dilutive securities 176,095 124,315 178,925 Weighted-\\\\naverage diluted shares 17,528,214 18,595,651 20,000,435 Basic earnings per\\\\nshare $ 3.31 $ 2.99 $ 3.00 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.28 $ 2.97 $ 2.98 The\\\\nCompany applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of\\\\npotentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing\\\\n62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of\\\\ndiluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been\\\\nantidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid\\\\ninvestments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase\\\\nare classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable\\\\ndebt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale.\\\\nThe Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or\\\\nlong-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.\\\\nUnrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as\\\\navailable-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss)\\\\n(“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are\\\\nclassified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for\\\\nuse in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are\\\\nmeasured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other\\\\nincome/(expense), net (“OI&E;”). The cost of securities sold is determined\\\\nusing the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured\\\\nusing the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment\\\\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line\\\\nbasis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is\\\\nthe lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and\\\\nfive years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and\\\\nmanufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life\\\\nfor leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software\\\\nare amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\\\\nassets, which range from three to seven years. Depreciation and amortization\\\\nexpense on property and equipment was $9.7 billion, $11.3 billion and $9.3\\\\nbillion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-cash investing\\\\nactivities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net\\\\nincrease/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of\\\\n$(2.9) billion and $3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Apple Inc.\\\\n| 2020 Form 10-K | 37 Non-Marketable Securities The Company has elected to\\\\napply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily\\\\ndeterminable fair values. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity\\\\nsecurities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for\\\\nchanges in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or\\\\nsimilar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable\\\\nequity securities are recognized in OI&E.; Restricted Cash and Restricted\\\\nMarketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to\\\\nbe restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The\\\\nCompany reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance\\\\nSheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the\\\\nexpected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted\\\\nmarketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying\\\\nsecurities. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s money\\\\nmarket funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted\\\\nprices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used\\\\nto measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other\\\\nfinancial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit\\\\nratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using\\\\nsignificant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\\\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of\\\\niPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue\\\\nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products\\\\nor services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred\\\\nwhen the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant\\\\nrisks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\\\\ncustomers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers\\\\nwhen products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control\\\\ntransfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\\\\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of\\\\ncontrol or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company\\\\nrecords reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns,\\\\nprice protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s\\\\nexpectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple\\\\nperformance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that\\\\nare distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance\\\\nobligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When\\\\navailable, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When\\\\nobservable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the\\\\nCompany’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\\\\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The\\\\nCompany’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and\\\\ncircumstances related to each performance obligation including, where\\\\napplicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends\\\\nin the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and\\\\nthe estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has\\\\nidentified up to three performance obligations regularly included in\\\\narrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software\\\\ndelivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right\\\\nto receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud,\\\\nSiri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a\\\\nwhen-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to\\\\nthe software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any\\\\nrelated discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\\\\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered\\\\nperformance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s\\\\nestimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled\\\\nsoftware is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is\\\\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\\\\nthey are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware\\\\nand bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at\\\\nthe time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services\\\\nand unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as\\\\nincurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has\\\\nperformance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these\\\\narrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered\\\\nservices. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates\\\\nentirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company\\\\nhas not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related\\\\nto these undelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38 For the sale\\\\nof third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product\\\\nbefore transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based\\\\non the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple\\\\nfactors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the\\\\nproduct, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the\\\\nresponsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\\\napplications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold\\\\nthrough the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not\\\\nobtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\\\\nTherefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing\\\\nin Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected\\\\nto record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to\\\\ngovernmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other\\\\ncurrent liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\\\\nDeferred Revenue Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant\\\\nproducts and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):\\\\n2020 2019 2018 iPhone (1) $ 137,781 $ 142,381 $ 164,888 Mac (1) 28,622 25,740\\\\n25,198 iPad (1) 23,724 21,280 18,380 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\\\\n30,620 24,482 17,381 Services (3) 53,768 46,291 39,748 Total net sales (4) $\\\\n274,515 $ 260,174 $ 265,595 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the\\\\ndeferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in\\\\nthe sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories\\\\nnet sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products,\\\\nHomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3)\\\\nServices net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare,\\\\ndigital content and other services. Services net sales also include\\\\namortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and\\\\nApple TV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\\\n(4) Includes $5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in\\\\ndeferred revenue as of September 28, 2019, $5.9 billion of revenue recognized\\\\nin 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018, and\\\\n$5.8 billion of revenue recognized in 2018 that was included in deferred\\\\nrevenue as of September 30, 2017. The Company’s proportion of net sales by\\\\ndisaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\\\\nsegment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2020, 2019\\\\nand 2018.

(3) As of September 26, 2020 and\\\\nSeptember 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $18.6 billion and\\\\n$18.9 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to\\\\nthe State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 40 The Company may sell certain of its\\\\nmarketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and\\\\nasset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt\\\\nsecurities generally range from one to five years. The Company typically\\\\ninvests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing\\\\nthe potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy\\\\ngenerally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of\\\\ncredit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each\\\\nindividual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable\\\\ndebt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors\\\\nsuch as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is\\\\nless than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes\\\\nthereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than\\\\nnot be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost\\\\nbasis. As of September 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its\\\\nmarketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-\\\\nMarketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of\\\\ncertain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As\\\\nof September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable\\\\nequity securities had a carrying value of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion,\\\\nrespectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash\\\\nequivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and\\\\nrestricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September\\\\n26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 Cash\\\\nand cash equivalents $ 38,016 $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other\\\\ncurrent assets 36 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets\\\\n1,737 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 39,789 $ 50,224 The\\\\nCompany’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s\\\\niPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use\\\\nderivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and\\\\ninterest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain\\\\nforeign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However,\\\\nthe Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons\\\\nincluding, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive\\\\neconomic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the\\\\nhedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\\\\nmovements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross\\\\nmargins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the\\\\nCompany’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\\\\na portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose\\\\nfunctional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted\\\\ninventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional\\\\ncurrencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or\\\\nother instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as\\\\ncash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted\\\\nforeign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases,\\\\ntypically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign\\\\noperation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\\\\nmay enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a\\\\nportion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to\\\\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may\\\\nuse non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign\\\\ncurrency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\\\\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments\\\\nas net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign\\\\ncurrency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\\\\nforeign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts,\\\\ncross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a\\\\nportion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in\\\\nfair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or\\\\nfair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt–\\\\nand marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected\\\\nto be recognized within 22 years. The Company may also enter into non-\\\\ndesignated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign\\\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\\\\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2020 Form 10-K | 41 To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term\\\\ndebt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company\\\\nmay enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These\\\\ninstruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense,\\\\nor changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either\\\\ncash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged\\\\ninterest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.\\\\nCash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment\\\\nof hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is\\\\nrecognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow\\\\nhedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales\\\\nin the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains\\\\nand losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized\\\\nas a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are\\\\nrecognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of\\\\ninterest income or expense are recognized in OI&E; in the same period as the\\\\nrelated income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow\\\\nhedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\\\\nand recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates\\\\non a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value\\\\nof amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized\\\\nin OCI. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-\\\\ndesignated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction\\\\nwill not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent\\\\ntwo-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\\\\nderivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E; in the period of de-\\\\ndesignation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative\\\\ninstruments are reflected in OI&E; unless they are re-designated as hedges of\\\\nother transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that\\\\nare included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a\\\\npart of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward\\\\ncontracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is\\\\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a\\\\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of\\\\namounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in\\\\nOCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts\\\\nthat are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in\\\\nearnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in\\\\nvalue of the hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of\\\\nOperations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value\\\\nhedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge\\\\neffectiveness and recognized in OI&E; on a straight-line basis over the life\\\\nof the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value\\\\nhedges and recognized in OI&E; were gains of $465 million and $777 million for\\\\n2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded\\\\nfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-\\\\nDesignated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\\\\ninstruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial\\\\nstatement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company records all\\\\nderivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s\\\\naccounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge\\\\ndesignation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at\\\\ngross fair value as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in\\\\nmillions): 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair\\\\nValue of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value\\\\nDerivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 749 $ 303 $ 1,052\\\\nInterest rate contracts $ 1,557 $ — $ 1,557 Derivative liabilities (2) :\\\\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1,561 $ 485 $ 2,046 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K |\\\\n42 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value\\\\nof Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative\\\\nassets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate\\\\ncontracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 (1)\\\\nThe fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value\\\\ninputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in\\\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table shows the\\\\nnotional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and\\\\ncredit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative\\\\ninstruments as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions):\\\\n2020 2019 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk\\\\nAmount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts\\\\n$ 57,410 $ 749 $ 61,795 $ 1,798 Interest rate contracts $ 20,700 $ 1,557 $\\\\n31,250 $ 685 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange\\\\ncontracts $ 88,636 $ 303 $ 76,868 $ 323 The notional amounts for outstanding\\\\nderivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume\\\\noutstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to\\\\ncredit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross\\\\nexposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are\\\\noutstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to\\\\nthe terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at\\\\neach respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk\\\\nwill vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table\\\\nabove reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s\\\\nderivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated\\\\nwith the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to\\\\nhedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial\\\\ninstruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,\\\\nwill depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the\\\\ninstruments. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 44 The Company generally enters\\\\ninto master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\\\\npermitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To\\\\nfurther limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral\\\\nsecurity arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted\\\\nwhen the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\\\\ncontractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative\\\\nassets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019,\\\\nthe net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative\\\\ninstruments under its collateral security arrangements was $875 million and\\\\n$1.6 billion, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and\\\\nreceived in other current assets and other current liabilities in the\\\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements\\\\nwith the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the\\\\nCompany is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable\\\\nby one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019,\\\\nthe potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s\\\\nderivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a\\\\nreduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.8 billion\\\\nand $2.7 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of\\\\n$312 million and $407 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade\\\\nReceivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with\\\\nits third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers,\\\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\\\\ncustomers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its\\\\ncustomers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit\\\\nsupport in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible,\\\\nthe Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit\\\\ninsurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans\\\\nor leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are\\\\ndirectly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As\\\\nsuch, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk\\\\nsharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both September 26, 2020\\\\nand September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually\\\\nrepresented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular\\\\nnetwork carriers accounted for 51% of total trade receivables as of September\\\\n28, 2019.

The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax\\\\nrate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed\\\\nrepatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a\\\\nnew minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected\\\\nto record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Provision for Income\\\\nTaxes and Effective Tax Rate The provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and\\\\n2018, consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Federal:\\\\nCurrent $ 6,306 $ 6,384 $ 41,425 Deferred ( 3,619 ) ( 2,939 ) ( 33,819 ) Total\\\\n2,687 3,445 7,606 State: Current 455 475 551 Deferred 21 ( 67 ) 48 Total 476\\\\n408 599 Foreign: Current 3,134 3,962 3,986 Deferred 3,383 2,666 1,181 Total\\\\n6,517 6,628 5,167 Provision for income taxes $ 9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 The\\\\nforeign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of\\\\n$38.1 billion, $44.3 billion and $48.0 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018,\\\\nrespectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 26, 2020, the total amount\\\\nof gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion,\\\\nif recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September\\\\n28, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.6\\\\nbillion, of which $8.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the\\\\nCompany’s effective tax rate.

Tax years\\\\nafter 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject\\\\nto examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an\\\\nadequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax\\\\nexaminations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with\\\\ncertainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in\\\\na manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to\\\\nadjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\\\\nAlthough the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the\\\\nCompany believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax\\\\nbenefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $3.9 billion.\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47 Interest and Penalties European Commission\\\\nState Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its\\\\ndecision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax\\\\nopinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the\\\\nIrish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”).\\\\nThe State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional\\\\ntaxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish\\\\nlegislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application\\\\nof the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated\\\\nto be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland\\\\nappealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice\\\\nof the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General\\\\nCourt annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European\\\\nCommission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of\\\\nJustice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income\\\\ntaxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable\\\\nagainst U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\\\\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister\\\\nfor Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other\\\\ncountries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.9\\\\nbillion, excluding interest.

Note 9 – Benefit Plans 2014 Employee Stock\\\\nPlan Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee\\\\nDirector Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that\\\\n(i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the\\\\nCompany’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants\\\\nof RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and\\\\nautomatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and\\\\n(iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and\\\\nrelative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award\\\\ngrants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the\\\\nCompany’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits\\\\nset forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs\\\\ngranted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for\\\\ngrant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The\\\\nDirector Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\\\\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and\\\\nother terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are\\\\naccumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26,\\\\n2020, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under\\\\nthe Director Plan. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 51 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\\\nDuring the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 officers\\\\nKatherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre\\\\nO’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance\\\\nwith Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a\\\\nwritten document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or\\\\nformula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or\\\\nsales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s\\\\nemployee and director equity plans. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee\\\\nStock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under\\\\nwhich substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock\\\\nthrough payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair\\\\nmarket values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month\\\\noffering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are\\\\nlimited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase\\\\nmore than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020,\\\\napproximately 107 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the\\\\nPurchase Plan. 401(k) Plan The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary\\\\narrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the\\\\n401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax\\\\nearnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($19,500 for calendar year\\\\n2020). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,\\\\ndepending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s\\\\neligible earnings.

The iPhone\\\\nUpgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a\\\\nspecified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are\\\\nmet. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and\\\\nrecognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with\\\\nsubsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.\\\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally\\\\navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained\\\\nfrom single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal\\\\ncomputers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components\\\\nused by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources,\\\\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity\\\\npricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not\\\\ncommonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company\\\\noften utilize custom components available from only one source. When a\\\\ncomponent or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may\\\\nexist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing\\\\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at\\\\nacceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\\\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components\\\\ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into\\\\nagreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no\\\\nguarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\\\\nsimilar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products\\\\nare manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia,\\\\nwith some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Apple Inc. |\\\\n2020 Form 10-K | 53 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered\\\\ninto certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of\\\\ngoods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s\\\\nunconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier\\\\narrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property\\\\nlicenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable\\\\nunconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one\\\\nyear as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions): 2021 $ 3,476 2022\\\\n2,885 2023 1,700 2024 357 2025 104 Thereafter 130 Total $ 8,652 Contingencies\\\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have\\\\narisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully\\\\nresolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more\\\\nlegal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for\\\\namounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and\\\\noperating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\\\\naffected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable\\\\npossibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss\\\\ngreater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted\\\\nlegal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX,\\\\nInc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of\\\\nthe Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11,\\\\n2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of\\\\n$503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals\\\\nfor the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the U.S. District\\\\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial\\\\nin October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at\\\\nissue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and\\\\nthe PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by\\\\nVirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters\\\\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various\\\\ninternational jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws,\\\\nfraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s\\\\nperformance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems,\\\\nintroduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek\\\\nmonetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S.\\\\nfederal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process\\\\ninto a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\\\nCalifornia (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020,\\\\nthe parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve\\\\nthe U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the\\\\nsettlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily\\\\napproved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $500 million in the\\\\naggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The\\\\nfinal amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of\\\\nconsumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the\\\\nCompany has agreed to pay at least $310 million to settle the claims. In\\\\naddition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental\\\\ninvestigations and requests for information relating to the performance\\\\nmanagement feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not\\\\ndefective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates\\\\n10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience,\\\\nand that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to\\\\ndisclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate\\\\nfor the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority On\\\\nMarch 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its\\\\ndecision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in\\\\nFrance violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion. The\\\\nCompany strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 54 Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related\\\\nentities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\\\\nDistrict of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s\\\\nproducts infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury\\\\nreturned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $506 million.\\\\nThe Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case\\\\nremains pending. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company\\\\nreports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management\\\\napproach designates the internal reporting used by management for making\\\\ndecisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable\\\\nsegments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.\\\\nThe Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater\\\\nChina, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South\\\\nAmerica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East\\\\nand Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest\\\\nof Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in\\\\nthe Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments\\\\nprovide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one\\\\nis managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s\\\\ncustomers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each\\\\ngeographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the\\\\nsame as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\\\\nPolicies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments\\\\nbased on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are\\\\ngenerally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s\\\\nretail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each\\\\nsegment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and\\\\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses\\\\nare generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are\\\\nincurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense\\\\nand certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded\\\\nfrom segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as\\\\nresearch and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based\\\\ncompensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other\\\\nseparately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not\\\\ninclude intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting\\\\npurposes.

Net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and\\\\nlong-lived assets as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as\\\\nfollows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Net sales: U.S. $ 109,197 $ 102,266 $\\\\n98,061 China (1) 40,308 43,678 51,942 Other countries 125,010 114,230 115,592\\\\nTotal net sales $ 274,515 $ 260,174 $ 265,595 2020 2019 Long-lived assets:\\\\nU.S. $ 25,890 $ 24,711 China (1) 7,256 9,064 Other countries 3,620 3,603 Total\\\\nlong-lived assets $ 36,766 $ 37,378 (1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\\\\nLong-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling and\\\\nmanufacturing process equipment and assets related to retail stores and\\\\nrelated infrastructure. Note 12 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements\\\\nfor certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate,\\\\nmanufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original\\\\nterms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options,\\\\nsome of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease\\\\narrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has\\\\nelected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single\\\\nlease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\\\\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and\\\\nvariable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the\\\\nunderlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the\\\\nCompany’s operating leases were $1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associated\\\\nwith variable payments on the Company’s leases were $9.3 billion for 2020.\\\\nRent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease\\\\naccounting standards, was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018,\\\\nrespectively. For 2020, the Company made $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments\\\\nrelated to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained\\\\nin exchange for lease liabilities were $10.5 billion for 2020, including the\\\\nimpact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.

Those standards require\\\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\\\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\\\\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\\\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\\\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\\\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\\\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\\\\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\\\\nopinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is\\\\na matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\\\nand that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\\\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\\\nor complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\\\nalter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\\\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\\\\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure\\\\nto which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As\\\\ndiscussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to\\\\ntaxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\\\\nmany state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total\\\\namount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8\\\\nbillion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple\\\\nInc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in\\\\nestimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits\\\\nand complex tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain\\\\ntax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of\\\\nthe benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant\\\\njudgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple\\\\nInc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 59 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested\\\\ncontrols relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\\\\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more\\\\nlikely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit\\\\nof its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To\\\\nevaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than\\\\nnot to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and\\\\nevaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple\\\\nInc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and\\\\ntechnical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject\\\\nmatter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s\\\\ntax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with\\\\nrelated taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received\\\\nexternal legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with\\\\nexternal advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated\\\\nApple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the\\\\nfinancial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s\\\\nauditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 29, 2020 Apple Inc. | 2020\\\\nForm 10-K | 60 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the\\\\nShareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal\\\\nControl Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria\\\\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\\\\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\\\n“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material\\\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\\\n26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with\\\\nthe standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\\\n(the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\\\n26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of\\\\noperations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each\\\\nof the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the related\\\\nnotes and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion\\\\nthereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for\\\\nmaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple\\\\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\\\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\\\nindependent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal\\\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in\\\\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\\\\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\\\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\\\\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\\\\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\\\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally\\\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 29, 2020\\\\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with\\\\nAccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and\\\\nProcedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an\\\\nevaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s\\\\nmanagement, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\\\\nofficer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\\\\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were\\\\neffective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files\\\\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\\\\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\\\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\\\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations\\\\nover Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\\\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\\\\npurposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\\\n(“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes\\\\nthose policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records\\\\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\\\ndispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\\\\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\\\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and\\\\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the\\\\nCompany’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\\\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\\\nfinancial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive\\\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\\\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control\\\\nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\\\\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\\\\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\\\\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\\\\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\\\\nevaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all\\\\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any\\\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to\\\\nthe risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes\\\\nin business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\\\\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control\\\\nover Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for\\\\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\\\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management\\\\nconducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control –\\\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,\\\\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting\\\\nwas effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance\\\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\\\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent\\\\nregistered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit\\\\nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which\\\\nappears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over\\\\nFinancial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control\\\\nover financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020, which were\\\\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph\\\\n(d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially\\\\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\\\\ninternal control over financial reporting.
