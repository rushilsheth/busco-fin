PART I Item 1. Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and\\nthe documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking\\nstatements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of\\nthis filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in\\nforward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.”\\nAmazon.com, Inc.’s principal corporate offices are located in Seattle,\\nWashington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our\\ncommon stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol\\n“AMZN.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include\\nAmazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\\nGeneral We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by\\nfour principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for\\ninvention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In\\neach of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of\\nconsumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In\\naddition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors,\\npublishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads,\\ndisplay, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three\\nsegments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These\\nsegments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and\\nmanages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of\\nPart II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment\\nInformation.” Consumers We serve consumers through our online and physical\\nstores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to\\nenable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third\\nparties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings\\nthrough our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically\\nvisiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices,\\nincluding Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, and other devices, and we\\ndevelop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices,\\nfast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer\\nservice. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that\\nincludes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to\\nunlimited streaming of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including\\nAmazon Original content, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a\\nnumber of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment\\nnetworks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain\\ncountries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate\\ncustomer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced\\narrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.” Sellers We offer programs\\nthat enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our\\nstores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in\\nthese transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit\\nactivity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\\nDevelopers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes,\\nincluding start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through\\nAWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including\\ncompute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other\\nservices. Content Creators We serve authors and independent publishers with\\nKindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and\\npublishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the\\nKindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We\\nalso offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app\\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. Table of Contents\\nCompetition Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service\\nofferings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we\\ncompete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad\\narray of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world.\\nOur current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and\\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and\\nproducers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2)\\npublishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive\\nmedia of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines,\\ncomparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online\\nand app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services,\\neither directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that\\nprovide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting,\\nomnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising,\\nfulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that\\nprovide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third\\nparties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information\\ntechnology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based\\ninfrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture,\\nmarket, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic\\ndevices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical\\nstores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in\\ndigital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in\\nour retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including\\nfast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller\\nand enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our\\nservices and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change\\nbusiness practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater\\nresources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and\\ngreater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may\\nsecure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue\\nrestrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct\\nconsumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers\\nwith restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology,\\ninfrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates\\ncompetitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new,\\nsmaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our\\nbusinesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business\\nmodels and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also\\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their\\ncompetitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service\\nmarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets,\\nproprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our\\nsuccess, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret\\nprotection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,\\ncustomers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have\\nregistered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and\\ninternational domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights.\\nAdditionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications\\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology. Seasonality Our business is\\naffected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales\\nvolume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Human Capital Our\\nemployees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric\\ncompany. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,298,000 full-\\ntime and part-time employees. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors\\nand temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified\\npersonnel has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers,\\ncomputer scientists, and other technical staff. We focus on investment and\\ninnovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and\\ndevelop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to\\nimplement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development,\\nincluding industry-leading pay and benefits, skills training programs such as\\nAmazon Career Choice and the Amazon Technical Academy, mentorship and support\\nresources, and programs that advance engagement, communication, and feedback.\\nAvailable Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we\\nencourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.\\nWe promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that\\nwe file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),\\ncorporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and\\nEthics), and select press releases.

Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following\\ndiscussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an\\ninvestment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in\\nthese risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to\\naccurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating\\nresults (including components of our financial results), cash flows,\\nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that\\nwe face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or\\nuncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not\\nconsider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the\\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our\\nbusiness and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and\\nin the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19\\npandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of\\nthe risks discussed below. Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense\\nCompetition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and\\nwe have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border\\ncompetition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and\\nomnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing\\nservices, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and\\ntransportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential\\ncompetitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or\\ngreater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and\\nservices and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms\\nfrom vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to\\ntechnology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues\\nto intensify, including with the development of new business models and the\\nentry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into\\nbusiness combinations or alliances and established companies in other market\\nsegments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and\\nenhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing\\nservices, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our\\ncompetition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison\\nshopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known\\nbusinesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and\\nservice offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose\\nbusiness, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any\\nof which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New\\nProducts, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to\\nAdditional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market\\nsegments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings.\\nThese offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges,\\nmay subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service\\ndisruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability,\\nif any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not\\nbe successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in\\nthem. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new\\ntechnologies, products, or services could result in the value of those\\ninvestments being written down or written off. Our International Operations\\nExpose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to\\nour revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In\\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating\\nexperience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or\\notherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain\\ninternational operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally.\\nOur international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international\\nsales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: local\\neconomic and political conditions; government regulation (such as regulation\\nof our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive\\ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export\\nduties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and\\nrestrictions on foreign ownership; restrictions on sales or distribution of\\ncertain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products,\\nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-\\nfriendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying\\nrules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital\\ndistribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property\\nrights; Table of Contents business licensing or certification requirements,\\nsuch as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency\\nexchange restrictions; limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact\\non cash flow; laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data\\nsecurity, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and\\nrestrictions on pricing or discounts; lower levels of use of the Internet;\\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared\\nto the U.S.; lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a\\nresult of distance, language, and cultural differences; different\\nemployee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor\\nunions; compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other\\napplicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government\\nofficials and other third parties; laws and policies of the U.S. and other\\njurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\\ngeopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical,\\ne-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will\\nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local\\ncompanies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their\\ngreater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their\\nmore established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and\\nmanage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. The\\nPeople’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its\\naffiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and\\nlicense requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation\\nof the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other\\nsectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products\\nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory\\nlicensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology\\nservices in China through contractual relationships with third parties that\\nhold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the\\nownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in\\nonline multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide\\ncertain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to\\nenable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect\\nminority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the\\nwww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities\\ncomply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India\\nmay from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their\\nregulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these\\nstructures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the\\ninterpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that\\nthese governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition,\\nour Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to\\noperate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in\\nChina, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place.\\nViolation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations\\nor changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result\\nin our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other\\nfinancial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure\\nour operations or shut down entirely. Table of Contents The Variability in Our\\nRetail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations Demand for our\\nproducts and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including\\nas a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable\\nevents, such as in response to natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather,\\nor geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of\\nour retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or\\nrestock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet\\ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth.\\nWhen we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory\\nmarkdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially\\nreduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping\\ncost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone\\nshipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too\\nmany customers access our websites within a short period of time due to\\nincreased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our\\nwebsites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which\\nmay reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our\\nproducts and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our\\nfulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and\\ndelivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may\\nbe unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item\\n1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified\\nduring periods of high demand. We generally have payment terms with our retail\\nvendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds\\nfrom our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31\\nof each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances\\ntypically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows\\nprovided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating\\ncycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December\\n31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three\\nmonths of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash\\nequivalents, and marketable securities balances. We Are Impacted by Fraudulent\\nor Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online\\nservice providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies\\nhave in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this\\nbusiness is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and\\nprocesses designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently\\nor otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the\\nproducts received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and\\nto prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling\\nunlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful\\nor unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise\\nviolating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or\\nfail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our\\nreputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful\\nactivities by our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for\\npayments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party\\nseller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively\\naffect our operating results. We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting\\nOur Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual\\nProperty Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks,\\ncopyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and\\nsimilar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on\\ntrademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and\\nconfidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and\\nothers to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property\\nprotection is not available in every country in which our products and\\nservices are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain\\nappropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business.\\nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks\\nand similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from\\nacquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the\\nvalue of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We are not always able\\nto discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary\\nrights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may\\nmaterially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The\\nprotection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of\\nsignificant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to\\nprotect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights\\nor prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary\\nrights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop\\nor otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual\\nproperty rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject\\nto, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the\\nintellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not\\nmeritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the\\nexpenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions\\nagainst us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy\\nindemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who\\nallege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available\\non terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the\\nincrease in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such\\nclaims. Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on\\neffective digital rights management technology to control access to digital\\ncontent. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology\\nthat we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling\\nto include their content in our service. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The\\nresults of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated\\nwith, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed\\nto foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating\\nresults may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have\\nexpanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate\\nfluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable\\nsecurities in foreign currencies including Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese\\nYen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash\\nequivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be\\nmaterially less than expected and vice versa. Operating Risks Our Expansion\\nPlaces a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and\\nOther Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our\\nglobal operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and\\nscaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The\\ncomplexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain\\non our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance,\\nfinancial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions,\\nand our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth\\neffectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively\\naffect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our\\nOperating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately\\nforecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on\\nsales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is\\nfixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our\\nsales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and\\nour percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit\\ngrowth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services\\noffered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic\\nand business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by\\nchanges in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global\\neconomies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating\\nresults will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors\\ndescribed elsewhere in this section and the following: our ability to retain\\nand increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy\\nour customers’ demands; our ability to retain and expand our network of\\nsellers; our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory,\\nand fulfill orders; the introduction of competitive stores, websites,\\nproducts, services, price decreases, or improvements; changes in usage or\\nadoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web\\nservices, including outside the U.S.; timing, effectiveness, and costs of\\nexpansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; the success of our\\ngeographic, service, and product line expansions; the extent to which we\\nfinance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and\\nfuture growth; the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include\\nsignificant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material\\nadverse impact on our operating results; variations in the mix of products and\\nservices we sell; variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\\nthe extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices\\nworldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; factors affecting\\nour reputation or brand image; the extent to which we invest in technology and\\ncontent, fulfillment, and other expense categories; Table of Contents\\nincreases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the\\nprices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing\\nsupplies and hardware products; the extent to which operators of the networks\\nbetween our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our\\ncustomers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; our\\nability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; the extent to\\nwhich new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online\\nadvertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor\\nour product and service offerings; the extent to which use of our services is\\naffected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of\\nservice attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events;\\nand disruptions from natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather,\\ngeopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed\\nhostilities), labor or trade disputes, and similar events. We Face Risks\\nRelated to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and\\nData Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise\\noptimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully\\nfrom time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center\\ncapacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could\\nmaterially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data\\ncenter capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our\\nfulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating\\nthem becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able\\nto operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize\\ninventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by\\nrequiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable\\nto adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers.\\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other\\ncompanies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and\\noperating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such\\ninventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform\\ninventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may\\nresult in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize\\nour fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our\\nbusiness and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to\\ndeliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. The inability\\nto negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or\\nother difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation\\nsystems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience.\\nIn addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship\\ncompleted orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or\\nman-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues,\\nlabor or trade disputes, and similar events. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss\\nor Other Security Breaches Because we collect, process, store, and transmit\\nlarge amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and\\nbusiness and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss,\\ntheft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or\\nour vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could: expose us\\nor our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information;\\nadversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or\\nregulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection,\\ndata security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or\\nsellers from using our stores and services; and otherwise harm our business\\nand reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of\\nreasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication\\ntechnology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office\\nsupport, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past\\nsecurity breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect\\non our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the\\nfuture. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to\\nprotect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and\\nprocesses designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party\\nvendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may\\nfail to operate as intended or be circumvented. We Face Risks Related to\\nSystem Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system\\ninterruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or\\nslow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders\\nor providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the\\nattractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and\\nhardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the\\nstability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system\\ninterruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. 10\\nTable of Contents Our computer and communications systems and operations in\\nthe past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to\\nevents such as natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical\\nevents and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed\\nhostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar\\nevents or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption,\\ndelays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and\\nfulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our\\nproduct and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our\\nsystems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be\\nsufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to\\ncompensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation\\nand be expensive to remedy. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the\\nFailure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could\\nNegatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other\\nkey personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and\\nChairman. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on\\nother highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the\\ntechnology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software\\nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of\\nour executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire, train,\\nretain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. Our Supplier\\nRelationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers,\\nincluding content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or\\nsingle-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,\\nmanufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content.\\nWe do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee\\navailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular\\npayment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current\\nsuppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content,\\ncomponents, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery,\\nincluding as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor\\neconomic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons,\\nmay result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in\\na timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition,\\nviolations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations,\\ncontractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain\\nStandards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or\\nhazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth,\\nand negatively affect our operating results. Our Commercial Agreements,\\nStrategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We\\nprovide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to\\nbusinesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business\\nrelationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology,\\nfulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable\\nsellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements\\nare complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and\\nother resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can\\nservice. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components\\nof these commercial relationships, which may include web services,\\nfulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment\\nprocessing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third\\nparties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under\\ncertain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of\\nthe other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are\\nnot successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the\\nagreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into\\nadditional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on\\nfavorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we\\nprovide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or\\ndeveloping these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to\\nrenew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in\\nthe future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties\\nthat have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could\\nadversely affect our operating results. Our present and future e-commerce\\nservices agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances\\ncreate additional risks such as: disruption of our ongoing business, including\\nloss of management focus on existing businesses; impairment of other\\nrelationships; variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending,\\nor terminating such agreements or relationships; and difficulty integrating\\nunder the commercial agreements. 11 Table of Contents Our Business Suffers\\nWhen We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions\\nand Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we\\nmay in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with\\nadditional companies. These transactions create risks such as: disruption of\\nour ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing\\nbusinesses; problems retaining key personnel; additional operating losses and\\nexpenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; the potential\\nimpairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a\\nresult of acquisitions; the potential impairment of customer and other\\nrelationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own\\ncustomers as a result of any integration of operations; the difficulty of\\ncompleting such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within\\nexpected timeframes, or at all; the difficulty of incorporating acquired\\noperations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated\\nexpenses related to such integration; the difficulty of integrating a new\\ncompany’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data\\nsecurity, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective\\nmanagement, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not\\nsuccessfully implemented; losses we may incur as a result of declines in the\\nvalue of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial\\nperformance into our financial results; for investments in which an investee’s\\nfinancial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in\\nfull or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial\\nreporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; the difficulty of\\nimplementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies\\nappropriate for a larger public company; the risks associated with businesses\\nwe acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the\\nrisks our other businesses face; potential unknown liabilities associated with\\na company we acquire or in which we invest; and for foreign transactions,\\nadditional risks related to the integration of operations across different\\ncultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks\\nassociated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or\\nmergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash,\\nor incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to\\nintangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our\\nbusiness or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition,\\nvaluations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change\\nrapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments\\nor other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact\\nour financial results. We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks\\ndescribed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and\\ninventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant\\ninventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of\\nseasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and\\npricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer\\nspending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products,\\nspoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends\\nand avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell.\\nDemand for products, however, can change significantly between the time\\ninventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we\\nbegin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish\\nvendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection,\\nand accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory\\nor components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not\\nbe returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of\\ncertain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to\\nsell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant\\nselling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may\\nadversely affect our operating results. We Are Subject to Payments-Related\\nRisks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card,\\ndebit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards,\\ndirect debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank\\ncheck, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we\\noffer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to\\nadditional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to\\nimplement enhanced authentication 12 Table of Contents processes that could\\nresult in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments\\nproducts), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and\\ndebit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time\\nand raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third\\nparties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment\\nprocessing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards,\\nelectronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt\\nour business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these\\nservices to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could\\nadversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or\\nterminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules,\\nincluding data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing\\nelectronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it\\ndifficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules\\nor requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise\\ndetect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems,\\ncould result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to\\nfines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit\\nand debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds\\ntransfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and\\noperating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide\\nregulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to\\nkeep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because\\nwe provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf.\\nJurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection,\\nbonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of\\ntransferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and\\nauthentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of\\nother laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering,\\ninternational money transfers, privacy, data protection, data security,\\nnetwork security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we\\nwere found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be\\nsubject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced\\nto cease providing certain services. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model\\nand Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business\\nmodel. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in\\nresponse to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A,\\nas well as: changes in interest rates; conditions or trends in the Internet\\nand the industry segments we operate in; quarterly variations in operating\\nresults; fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for\\nInternet-related companies in particular; changes in financial estimates by us\\nor decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\\nchanges in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or\\nequity to the public; changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance\\nby, other e-commerce or technology companies; and transactions in our common\\nstock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.\\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and\\nfinancing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to\\nemployees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could\\nhurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing\\nstockholders, or both. Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is\\nEvolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to\\ngeneral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws\\nspecifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel\\nretail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising,\\nartificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and\\nservices that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation,\\nprivacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer\\nprotection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile\\ncommunications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy\\nconsumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other\\ncommunications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web\\nservices, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing,\\nand information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our\\nservices or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites,\\nhealth, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and\\nquality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation\\nof unmanned aircraft systems, and other matters. It is not clear how existing\\nlaws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data\\nprotection, data security, network security, and consumer protection apply to\\naspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content,\\nweb services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial 13 Table of\\nContents intelligence technologies and services. A large number of\\njurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of\\nsuch regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses\\nexpand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and\\ninvestigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws,\\nregulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to\\nregulate our operations. For example, a number of regulators have opened\\ninvestigations to assess whether aspects of our operations violate competition\\nrules. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by\\ngovernment or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or\\ninquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by\\nthem, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated\\ncivil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary\\nfines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and\\nservices, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our\\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our\\nreputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our\\noperations. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other\\nProceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an\\ninnovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and\\nservices around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened\\nclaims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including\\nproceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range\\nof issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes,\\nlabor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data protection,\\ndata security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes,\\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The\\nnumber and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our\\nbusinesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products,\\nservices, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used\\nby, more people. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect\\non us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of\\nmanagement resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of\\nthese matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant\\nuncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters\\ninvolves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and\\nunpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be\\nexposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be\\nmaterial. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have\\nbeen incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated\\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is\\npossible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a\\nresult of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or\\norders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from\\noffering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business\\npractices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring\\ndevelopment of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies,\\ndamaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our\\noperations. We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property\\nAre Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell\\nor manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating\\nto personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and\\ncan require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products\\nusing our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims.\\nAlthough we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our\\ncoverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance\\nwill continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at\\nall. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to\\nprohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect,\\nenforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In\\naddition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify\\nus from product liability. 14 Table of Contents We Face Additional Tax\\nLiabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes\\nand tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous\\nforeign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject\\nto additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection\\nobligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices,\\nprinciples, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the\\nglobal tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in\\nvarious jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic,\\npolitical, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are\\nconsidering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new\\ntax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the\\nremote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect\\nsales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and\\nremote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third\\nparty obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and\\nother countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and\\nmarketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could\\nbe adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us\\nprospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from\\nthe failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide\\ninformation about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax\\nreporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may\\nnot have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes\\nto properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the\\neffective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other\\nfactors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions,\\ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany\\ntransactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in\\njurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the\\napplicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts\\nof income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and\\nchanges in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary\\ncourse of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which\\nthe ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required\\nin evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. We are\\nalso subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in\\ntax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other\\ntax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash\\nflows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as\\nfor prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an\\nadverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of\\nour tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the\\nfinal outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could\\nbe materially different from our historical tax accruals. We Are Subject to\\nRisks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our\\ncontracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities\\nare subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating\\nto their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits\\nand investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations\\ncould result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative\\nsanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of\\npayments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment\\nfrom future government business.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of\\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other\\nthan statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance,\\nindustry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position,\\nmade in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such\\nas anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to\\nidentify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect\\nmanagement’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results\\ncould differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others,\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions\\nand customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet,\\nonline commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new\\nbusiness opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of\\nproducts and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from\\nproducts as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other\\ntaxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating\\nresults, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims,\\nlitigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment,\\nsortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory\\nmanagement, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into,\\nmaintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed\\nacquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of\\nfulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic\\nclimate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic\\namplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other\\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ\\nsignificantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail\\nin Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue\\nis the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The\\nproducts offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have\\npurchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also\\nmanufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally,\\nwe recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product\\nsales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party\\nsellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores,\\nthrough increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We\\nalso offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings,\\nfulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our\\nfinancial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free\\ncash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently\\nmanaging accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital\\nexpenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and\\nequipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in\\nsales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs,\\npartially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives,\\nincluding capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience.\\nTo increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects\\nof the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability,\\noffering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection,\\nproducing original content, increasing product categories and service\\nofferings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving\\nreliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP\\nFinancial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash\\nflows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and\\nwork to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and\\ncontent costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking,\\npackaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service\\nsupport, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our\\nfixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology\\ninfrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web\\nservices, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize\\nour fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally\\nchange directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent\\non the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and\\nother factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable\\nus to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing,\\nincrease discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To\\nminimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process\\nefficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to\\nturn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle On\\naverage, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers\\nbefore our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory\\nturnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our\\nproduct mix, the mix of sales The operating cycle is the number of days of\\nsales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable\\nminus accounts payable days. 19 Table of Contents by us and by third-party\\nsellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection\\nof product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and\\nthe extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We\\nalso expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are\\naffected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of\\nsales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes\\nin payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and\\ntiming of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and\\ncontent will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers,\\nsoftware and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology\\nand content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety\\nof product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-\\nfunctionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in\\nseveral areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new\\nand existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in\\ntechnology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our\\nprocess efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the\\nspeed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics,\\nimproved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial\\nintelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience\\non the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take\\nadvantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS,\\nwhich offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute,\\nstorage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to\\ndevelopers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives\\nto build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices.\\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the\\nflexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings,\\nacquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests.\\nWe utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity\\ncompensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term\\ninterests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder\\ndilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without\\nregard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding\\nstock awards were 512 million and 518 million as of December 31, 2019 and\\n2020. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in\\nforeign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and\\nconsolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year\\nrelative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net\\nsales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained\\nconstant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to\\ncurrencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and\\noperating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We\\nbelieve that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through\\nour growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-\\nterm. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and\\ngrowth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the\\nremeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and\\nlosses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange\\nrates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact\\n(either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends\\nand comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed\\nabove, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary\\nData — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental\\nDisclosures.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\\n2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results\\nof operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 in Item 7 of Part II,\\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations.” Effects of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global\\ndisruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers,\\nsuppliers, and third-party sellers. To serve our customers while also\\nproviding for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have\\nmodified numerous aspects of our logistics, transportation, supply chain,\\npurchasing, and third-party seller processes. Beginning in Q1 2020, we made\\nnumerous process updates across our operations worldwide, and adapted our\\nfulfillment network, to implement employee and customer safety measures, such\\nas enhanced cleaning and physical distancing, personal protective gear,\\ndisinfectant spraying, and temperature checks. Since February 2020, we have\\nhired over 400,000 full-time and part-time employees to increase our\\nfulfillment network capacity. We incurred approximately $4.0 billion in\\nCOVID-19 related costs in Q4 2020, for a total of more than $11.5 billion\\nduring 2020. We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and\\ncomply with evolving federal, state, and local standards as well as to\\nimplement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests\\nof our employees, customers, and communities. 20 Table of Contents Critical\\nAccounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”)\\nrequires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\\nand liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent\\nliabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\\nThe SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that\\nare most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and\\nresults of operations, and which require the company to make its most\\ndifficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make\\nestimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition,\\nwe have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed\\nbelow. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of\\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding\\nour results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business,\\nAccounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that\\nour estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon\\ninformation presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from\\nthese estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are\\nprimarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at\\nthe lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make\\njudgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method\\nof disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to\\nproduct vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each\\ndisposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory\\nare inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may\\ncause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of\\nsensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of\\nDecember 31, 2020, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of\\napproximately $270 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments\\nfor certain electronic device components and certain products. These\\ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these\\ncommitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes We are subject to\\nincome taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign\\njurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,\\nand interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\\nchange, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other\\nconditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating\\nour provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that\\noccur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax\\ndetermination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings\\nare subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions, such\\nas the COVID-19 pandemic, and significant judgment is required in determining\\nour ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be\\naffected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations,\\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies,\\nintercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,\\nincluding earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have\\nlower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we\\nhave higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are\\nnot able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax\\nregimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock\\nprice, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of\\njurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,\\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax,\\nincluding changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries\\nhave enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to\\ncorporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies\\nin various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income\\ntax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other\\ntax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash\\nflows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as\\nfor prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an\\nadverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of\\nour tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the\\nfinal outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could\\nbe materially different from our historical income tax provisions and\\naccruals. 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow\\ninformation is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020\\nCash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Investing\\nactivities (24,281) (59,611) Financing activities (10,066) (1,104) Our\\nprincipal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and\\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair\\nvalue, were $55.0 billion and $84.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.\\nAmounts held in foreign currencies were $15.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2020, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and\\nJapanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $38.5\\nbillion and $66.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. Our operating cash flows result\\nprimarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise,\\nand content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we\\nmake for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and\\nrelated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our\\nlong-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities\\ngenerally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit\\ncards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The\\nincrease in operating cash flow in 2020, compared to the prior year, was\\nprimarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and\\nchanges in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is\\nsubject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory\\nmanagement and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments,\\nvendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash\\nprovided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital\\nexpenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from\\nproperty and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for\\nacquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights,\\nand purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided\\nby (used in) investing activities was $(24.3) billion and $(59.6) billion in\\n2019 and 2020, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to\\npurchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales\\nof marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $12.7 billion, and\\n$35.0 billion in 2019 and 2020, which primarily reflect investments in\\nadditional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of\\ncontinued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which\\nis to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made\\ncash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other\\ninvestment activity of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash\\nprovided by (used in) financing activities was $(10.1) billion and $(1.1)\\nbillion in 2019 and 2020. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from\\nproceeds of short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $2.3 billion and\\n$17.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash outflows from financing activities\\nresulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance\\nleases, and financing obligations of $12.3 billion and $18.4 billion in 2019\\nand 2020. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $13.7\\nbillion and $11.6 billion in 2019 and 2020, reflecting investments in support\\nof continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology\\ninfrastructure for AWS. We had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured\\nrevolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”), $725 million of borrowings\\noutstanding under the commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper\\nProgram”), and $338 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured\\nrevolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2020. See\\nItem 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 —\\nDebt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash\\nequivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $17.2\\nbillion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary\\nearnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely\\noutside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur\\nsignificant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Tax benefits\\nrelating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated\\ndepreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income, and all\\nremaining federal tax credits, which were primarily related to the U.S.\\nfederal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in\\n2020. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions\\nby allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily\\nequipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of\\nfull expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election\\nfor 2020. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $881 million and $1.7 billion\\nfor 2019 and 2020. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis,\\nrather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European\\nCommission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax\\nauthorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the 22 Table\\nof Contents European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million,\\nthat we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending\\nconclusion of all appeals. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, restricted cash,\\ncash equivalents, and marketable securities were $321 million and $257\\nmillion. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —\\nNote 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our\\nprincipal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets.\\nAdditionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of\\ninventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $26.6 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2020. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are\\ngenerally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash\\nequivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing\\narrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs\\nfor at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash\\nneeds and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of\\nPart I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell\\nadditional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance\\nand operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase\\ncommon stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise\\nrestructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our\\nfinancial position. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions\\nhave caused significant market volatility. These disruptions can contribute to\\ndefaults in our accounts receivable, affect asset valuations resulting in\\nimpairment charges, and affect the availability of lease and financing credit\\nas well as other segments of the credit markets. We have utilized a range of\\nfinancing methods to fund our operations and capital expenditures and expect\\nto continue to maintain financing flexibility in the current market\\nconditions. However, due to the rapidly evolving global situation, it is not\\npossible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are\\nreasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in\\nthe future. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would\\nbe dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time,\\nconsider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses,\\nproducts, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might\\naffect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing,\\nor issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that\\nadditional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts\\nor on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 23 Table of Contents Results of\\nOperations We have organized our operations into three segments: North\\nAmerica, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company\\nevaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of\\nPart II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment\\nInformation.” Effects of COVID-19 As reflected in the discussion below, the\\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it had\\nvarying effects on our 2020 results of operations. Higher net sales in the\\nNorth America and International segments reflect increased demand,\\nparticularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples\\nand other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network\\ncapacity and supply chain constraints. Other effects in the North America and\\nInternational segments include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales\\nas a percentage of net sales, primarily due to the impact of lower\\nproductivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain\\nsafe workplaces. We expect the effects of fulfillment network capacity and\\nsupply chain constraints, elevated collection risk in our accounts receivable,\\nand increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales\\nto continue into all or portions of Q1 2021. However, it is not possible to\\ndetermine the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence,\\nthe actions taken in response to the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic\\nrecovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and\\nspending patterns, or other impacts of the pandemic, and whether these or\\nother currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably\\nlikely to materially affect our results of operations. 24 Table of Contents\\nNet Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent\\nrevenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media\\ncontent where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent\\nthird-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related\\nfulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime\\nmembership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales\\ninformation is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net\\nSales: North America $ 170,773 $ 236,282 International 74,723 104,412 AWS\\n35,026 45,370 Consolidated $ 280,522 $ 386,064 Year-over-year Percentage\\nGrowth: North America 21 % 38 % International 13 40 AWS 37 30 Consolidated 20\\n38 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange\\nrates: North America 21 % 38 % International 17 38 AWS 37 30 Consolidated 22\\n37 Net sales mix: North America 61 % 61 % International 27 27 AWS 12 12\\nConsolidated 100 % 100 % Sales increased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior\\nyear. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(2.6)\\nbillion and $1.4 billion for 2019 and 2020. For a discussion of the effect of\\nforeign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates”\\nbelow. North America sales increased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior year.\\nThe sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by\\nthird-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued\\nefforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping\\noffers, and increased demand, including for household staples and other\\nessential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity\\nand supply chain constraints. International sales increased 40% in 2020,\\ncompared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit\\nsales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were\\ndriven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers,\\nincluding from our shipping offers, and increased demand, including for\\nhousehold staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by\\nfulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. Changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(2.4) billion and\\n$1.7 billion in 2019 and 2020. AWS sales increased 30% in 2020, compared to\\nthe prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage,\\npartially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by\\nour continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 25 Table of Contents\\nOperating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in\\nmillions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Operating Income (Loss): North\\nAmerica $ 7,033 $ 8,651 International (1,693) 717 AWS 9,201 13,531\\nConsolidated $ 14,541 $ 22,899 Operating income was $14.5 billion and $22.9\\nbillion for 2019 and 2020. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more\\nmeaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of\\nour product categories and services. The increase in North America operating\\nincome in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily\\ndue to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and\\nadvertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially\\noffset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We\\nexpect North America operating income to continue to be negatively impacted\\nthrough at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign\\nexchange rates impacted operating income by $23 million and $8 million for\\n2019 and 2020. The International operating income in 2020, as compared to the\\noperating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales,\\nincluding sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower\\ngrowth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping\\nand fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect International\\noperating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1\\n2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted\\noperating income (loss) by $(116) million and $411 million for 2019 and 2020.\\nThe increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to\\nthe prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost\\nstructure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization\\nexpense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers, partially\\noffset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology\\ninfrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments\\nto support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes\\nin foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $273 million and $30\\nmillion for 2019 and 2020. 26 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information\\nabout operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31,\\n2019 2020 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 165,536 $ 233,307 Fulfillment\\n40,232 58,517 Technology and content 35,931 42,740 Marketing 18,878 22,008\\nGeneral and administrative 5,203 6,668 Other operating expense (income), net\\n201 (75) Total operating expenses $ 265,981 $ 363,165 Year-over-year\\nPercentage Growth: Cost of sales 19 % 41 % Fulfillment 18 45 Technology and\\ncontent 25 19 Marketing 37 17 General and administrative 20 28 Other operating\\nexpense (income), net (32) (137) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 59.0 %\\n60.4 % Fulfillment 14.3 15.2 Technology and content 12.8 11.1 Marketing 6.7\\n5.7 General and administrative 1.9 1.7 Other operating expense (income), net\\n0.1 — Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of\\nconsumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs\\nrelated to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation\\nservice provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue\\ngross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute\\ndollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased\\nproduct and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. We expect cost of\\nsales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted\\nthrough at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Shipping costs to receive\\nproducts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as\\ncost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which\\ninclude sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $37.9\\nbillion and $61.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. We expect our cost of shipping to\\ncontinue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping\\noffers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods,\\nincluding faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to\\nmitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales\\nvolumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our\\nsuppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that\\noffering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and\\none way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our\\nAWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we\\nleverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology\\nrequirements and external sales to AWS customers. 27 Table of Contents\\nFulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in\\noperating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment\\ncenters, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing\\ncosts. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included\\nin “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and\\ncontent.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to\\nseveral factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our\\nlevel of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of\\nunits received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize\\nFulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical\\nstore expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third\\nparties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer\\nservice contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and\\nenhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our\\nsellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a\\npercentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment\\nprocessing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying\\ntransactions. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020,\\ncompared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding\\nwith increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, costs\\nfrom expanding our fulfillment network, and the COVID-19 related impact of\\nlower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to\\nmaintain safe workplaces. We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net\\nsales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by\\nCOVID-19 related costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to\\naccommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet\\nanticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales\\nby third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly\\nevaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and\\ncontent costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in\\nthe research and development of new and existing products and services,\\ndevelopment, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of\\nproducts and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure\\ncosts. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data\\ncenter related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other\\nexpenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively,\\nthese costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety\\nof products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in\\nnumerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the\\ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid\\ntechnology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our\\ntechnology and content investment and capital spending projects often support\\na variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the\\ncross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in\\ntechnology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees\\nand technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on\\nusage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in\\n2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and\\nrelated costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our\\nexisting products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and\\nservice offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure,\\noffset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change\\nin the estimated useful life of our servers. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business,\\nAccounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for\\nadditional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers.\\nMarketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses\\nfor personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\\ncommissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily\\nthrough a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third\\nparty customer referrals, social and online advertising, television\\nadvertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable,\\nbased on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is\\nincreased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent\\nour mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding\\nchange in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute\\ndollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased\\npayroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling\\nactivities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a\\nresult of COVID-19. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership\\nbenefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we\\nview these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to\\ncontinue offering them indefinitely. 28 Table of Contents General and\\nAdministrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute\\ndollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in\\npayroll and related expenses and professional service fees. Other Operating\\nExpense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $201 million\\nand $(75) million during 2019 and 2020, and was primarily related to a benefit\\nfrom accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020,\\noffset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible\\nassets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $832 million and\\n$555 million during 2019 and 2020. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-\\nrated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\\nfixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average\\nbalance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending\\non the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense\\nwas $1.6 billion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and\\nfinance leases. Our long-term lease liabilities were $39.8 billion and $52.6\\nbillion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our long-term debt was $23.4 billion\\nand $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II,\\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 —\\nDebt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income\\n(expense), net was $203 million and $2.4 billion during 2019 and 2020. The\\nprimary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity\\nwarrant valuations, equity securities valuations and adjustments, and foreign\\ncurrency. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant\\nvariation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and\\ntaxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate,\\nintercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes\\nin how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments,\\nchanges in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities\\nand their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes,\\nregulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and\\ninterpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,\\ncompetition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and\\nrelative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not\\nrecognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the\\namount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items\\nand non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-\\ntax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against\\ndeferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate\\nfuture income in relevant jurisdictions, and the effects of the COVID-19\\npandemic on our business make estimates of future income more challenging. We\\nrecorded a provision for income taxes of $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019\\nand 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\n— Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Non-GAAP Financial\\nMeasures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and\\nother SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain\\nnon-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect\\nof foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet\\nthe definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of\\nfree cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional\\nperspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and\\nthrough finance leases and financing obligations. 29 Table of Contents Free\\nCash Flow Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of\\nproperty and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The\\nfollowing is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP\\ncash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for\\n2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash\\nprovided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of\\nproperty and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689)\\n(35,044) Free cash flow $ 25,825 $ 31,020 Net cash provided by (used in)\\ninvesting activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in)\\nfinancing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) Free Cash Flow Less Principal\\nRepayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less\\nprincipal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash\\nflow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal\\nrepayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases\\nand financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our\\nfinance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of\\nfree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing\\nobligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided\\nby (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year\\nEnded December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating\\nactivities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of\\nproceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow 25,825\\n31,020 Principal repayments of finance leases (9,628) (10,642) Principal\\nrepayments of financing obligations (27) (53) Free cash flow less principal\\nrepayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ 16,170 $ 20,325 Net\\ncash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash\\nprovided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) 30 Table of\\nContents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments\\nof All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less\\nequipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases\\nand financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired\\nunder finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired\\nunder finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease\\nliabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,”\\nand “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease\\nliabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure,\\nequipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had\\nbeen purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been\\nleased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment\\nfinance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and\\nfinancing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash\\nprovided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating\\nactivities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of\\nproceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow 25,825\\n31,020 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (12,916) (9,104) Principal\\nrepayments of all other finance leases (2) (392) (427) Principal repayments of\\nfinancing obligations (27) (53) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases\\nand principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations\\n$ 12,490 $ 21,436 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $\\n(24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $\\n(10,066) $ (1,104) ___________________ (1) For the year ended December 31,\\n2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and\\nequipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million and $11,588\\nmillion. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount\\nrelates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of\\n$9,628 million and $10,642 million. All of these free cash flows measures have\\nlimitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement\\nand do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary\\nexpenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not\\nincorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt\\nor cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property\\nand equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change\\nover time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows\\nmeasures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash\\nflows. 31 Table of Contents Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information\\nregarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our\\nnet sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show\\nreported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the\\nsame as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods. The effect on\\nour net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our\\nforeign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2020 As Reported Exchange\\nRate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1)\\nAt Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 280,522 $ 2,560 $ 283,082 $ 386,064 $\\n(1,438) $ 384,626 Operating expenses 265,981 2,740 268,721 363,165 (989)\\n362,176 Operating income 14,541 (180) 14,361 22,899 (449) 22,450 ___\\n________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from\\nchanges in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior\\nyear period for operating results. (2) Represents the outcome that would have\\nresulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as\\nthose in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.\\nGuidance We provided guidance on February 2, 2021, in our earnings release\\nfurnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements\\nreflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2021, and are subject to\\nsubstantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be\\nmaterially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange\\nrates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world\\nevents, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud\\nservices, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This\\nguidance reflects our estimates as of February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and\\nis highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or\\ncontrol, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any\\nrecurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in\\nresponse to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional\\neconomies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our\\nsignificant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability\\nto continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending\\npatterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party\\nsellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on\\nconsumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over\\nthe current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during\\nthe first quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth\\nbelow. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our\\noperations for the first quarter of 2021, or whether other currently\\nunanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably\\nlikely to materially affect our operations. First Quarter 2021 Guidance Net\\nsales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow\\nbetween 33% and 40% compared with first quarter 2020. This guidance\\nanticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign\\nexchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and\\n$6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. This guidance\\nassumes approximately $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19. This guidance\\nassumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions,\\ninvestments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 32 Table of\\nContents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign\\ncurrency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.\\nInformation relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market\\nrisk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and\\nCapital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes\\nin interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-\\nterm debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in\\ninterest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However,\\nthe fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will\\ngenerally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of\\ndeclining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of\\ninterest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds\\nand investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities.\\nFixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected\\ndue to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if\\nforced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in\\ninterest rates. The following table provides information about our cash\\nequivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash\\nflows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as\\nof December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages): 2021 2022 2023 2024\\n2025 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2020 Money\\nmarket funds $ 27,430 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 27,430 $ 27,430 Weighted average\\ninterest rate (0.16) % — % — % — % — % — % (0.16) % Corporate debt securities\\n16,505 4,459 5,531 1,990 886 — 29,371 29,988 Weighted average interest rate\\n0.42 % 1.65 % 1.32 % 1.86 % 1.84 % 0.92 % U.S. government and agency\\nsecurities 5,439 587 899 298 67 71 7,361 7,439 Weighted average interest rate\\n0.30 % 1.38 % 1.12 % 1.74 % 1.13 % 2.97 % 0.58 % Asset-backed securities 870\\n773 472 763 243 46 3,167 3,235 Weighted average interest rate 2.08 % 2.00 %\\n1.53 % 2.13 % 1.57 % 1.25 % 1.94 % Foreign government and agency securities\\n4,932 147 45 3 — — 5,127 5,131 Weighted average interest rate 0.25 % 0.74 %\\n1.28 % 1.76 % — % — % 0.28 % Other fixed income securities 109 156 230 160 43\\n— 698 710 Weighted average interest rate 2.10 % 1.85 % 1.10 % 0.84 % 1.31 % —\\n% 1.38 % $ 55,285 $ 6,122 $ 7,177 $ 3,214 $ 1,239 $ 117 $ 73,154 Cash\\nequivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 73,933 As of December 31,\\n2020, we had long-term debt with a face value of $33.2 billion, including the\\ncurrent portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes.\\nSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 —\\nDebt” for additional information. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2020, net sales\\nfrom our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues.\\nNet sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused\\nstores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North\\nAmerica segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of\\nthe corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and\\nJapanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany\\nbalances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are\\nexposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign\\nexchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ\\nmaterially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on\\nthe remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates\\nin effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.7\\nbillion in comparison with the prior year. 33 Table of Contents We have\\nforeign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents,\\nand marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign\\nfunds as of December 31, 2020, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20%\\nadverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.2\\nbillion, $2.4 billion, and $4.7 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are\\nrecorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate\\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable\\nfair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated\\nbalance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net\\nincome. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances\\ndenominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances\\nas of December 31, 2020, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign\\nexchange rates would result in losses of $245 million, $485 million, and $970\\nmillion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II,\\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for\\nadditional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign\\nexchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2020, our recorded\\nvalue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies\\nwas $6.9 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded\\ncompanies represent $3.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2020,\\nand are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility.\\nWe assess our equity investments in private companies for impairment.\\nValuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of\\nreadily available market data. The current global economic climate provides\\nadditional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not\\npracticable. 34 Table of Contents Item 8.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with\\nthe standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error\\nor fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to\\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\\nreasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit\\nmatter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of\\nthe consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to\\nwhich it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter The\\nCompany is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign\\njurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax\\npositions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result,\\nsignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and\\ndetermining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant\\njudgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more\\nlikely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit\\nthat qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company accrued\\nliabilities of $2.8 billion for various tax contingencies. Auditing the\\nmeasurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the\\nevaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained\\nand the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex,\\ninvolves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and\\nlegal rulings. 36 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\\nWe tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits\\nof its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether\\na tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process\\nto measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the\\nrelated disclosures. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and\\nresearch and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits\\nof certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the\\nspecific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax\\nauthorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining\\nthe Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax\\nauthorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions\\nare based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international,\\ntransfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax\\nauthorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We\\nevaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess\\npotential effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in\\nrelevant court cases. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to\\ndetermine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of\\nthe Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax\\ndisclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young\\nLLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES\\nTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS,\\nACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES Description of Business We\\nseek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we\\nserve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers,\\nenterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and\\nphysical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer\\nprograms that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in\\nour stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors,\\nmusicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and\\nsell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS,\\nwhich offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute,\\nstorage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We\\nalso manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide\\nservices, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and\\nothers, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video\\nadvertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North\\nAmerica, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.” Prior\\nPeriod Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified\\nto conform to the current period presentation. “Proceeds from short-term debt,\\nand other” were reclassified from “Proceeds from long-term debt and other” and\\n“Repayments of short-term debt, and other” were reclassified from “Repayments\\nof long-term debt and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the\\naccounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the\\n“Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in\\nwhich we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary,\\nincluding certain entities in India and certain entities that support our\\nseller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions\\nbetween consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation\\nof financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\\nrevenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in\\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are\\nused for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment,\\ncommitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill,\\nstock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory\\nvaluation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of\\ninvestments. Given the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen\\neffects from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates have become more\\nchallenging, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\\n43 Table of Contents Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table\\nshows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): Year Ended December\\n31, 2018 2019 2020 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest\\non debt $ 854 $ 875 $ 916 Cash paid for operating leases $ — $ 3,361 $ 4,475\\nCash paid for interest on finance leases $ 381 $ 647 $ 612 Cash paid for\\ninterest on financing obligations $ 194 $ 39 $ 102 Cash paid for income taxes,\\nnet of refunds $ 1,184 $ 881 $ 1,713 Assets acquired under operating leases $\\n— $ 7,870 $ 16,217 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases $\\n10,615 $ 13,723 $ 11,588 Property and equipment acquired under build-to-suit\\narrangements $ 3,641 $ 1,362 $ 2,267 Earnings per Share Basic earnings per\\nshare is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares.\\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average\\noutstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as\\ndetermined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net\\nloss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as\\ntheir inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows\\nthe calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018\\n2019 2020 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 487 494 500\\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 10 10 Shares used in\\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share 500 504 510 Revenue Revenue is\\nmeasured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive,\\nreduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and\\nrebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third\\nparties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have\\nmultiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each\\nperformance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We\\ngenerally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to\\ncustomers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal\\nrevenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales We offer consumer\\nproducts through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when\\ncontrol of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs\\nupon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon\\ndelivery, to the customer. Third-party seller services We offer programs that\\nenable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders\\nthrough us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The\\ncommissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these\\narrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally\\noccurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in\\nthe case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Subscription services Our\\nsubscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and\\naccess to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books,\\nand other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our\\ncustomers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single\\nstand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in\\nadvance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is\\nrecognized over the subscription period. AWS Our AWS arrangements include\\nglobal sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is\\nallocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily\\nrecognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of\\nservices rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand.\\nCertain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed\\nquantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales\\ncommissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are\\ncapitalized and amortized over the contract term. 44 Table of Contents Other\\nOther revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are\\nrecognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\\nReturn Allowances Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the\\npurchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs,\\nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the\\ntransportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we\\nrecord revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive\\nproducts from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as\\ncost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and\\nrelated transaction costs, including those associated with seller\\ntransactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements\\nof operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to\\nreceive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions,\\nincentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received\\nfrom vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including\\nproperty and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the\\ncost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume\\nrebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate\\nthe likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and\\ncurrent year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we\\nrecord a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase\\nthreshold. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs\\nincurred in operating and staffing our North America and International\\nsegments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers,\\nincluding costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing\\ninventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment;\\npayment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated\\nwith our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries\\nfrom customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic\\ndevices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that\\nassist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Technology and\\nContent Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for\\nemployees involved in the research and development of new and existing\\nproducts and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores,\\ncuration and display of products and services made available in our online\\nstores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers,\\nnetworking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization,\\nrent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon\\nbusinesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order\\nto offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology\\nand content costs are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing Marketing\\ncosts primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for\\npersonnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\\ncommissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their\\ncustomer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative\\nadvertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.\\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services\\nare expensed as incurred and were $8.2 billion, $11.0 billion, and $10.9\\nbillion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. 45 Table of Contents General and\\nAdministrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs\\nfor corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities\\nand equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and\\nrent; and professional fees and litigation costs. Stock-Based Compensation\\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is\\nmeasured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service\\nperiod. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the\\nnumber of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value\\nis recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated\\nforfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock\\nawards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual\\nresults or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts\\nwill be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are\\nrevised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,\\nincluding historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally,\\nstock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected\\nto settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair\\nvalue at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.\\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net,\\nconsists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to\\nacquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020\\nand the amortization of intangible assets. Other Income (Expense), Net During\\nthe period from January 1, 2021 to February 2, 2021, we expect to record\\nupward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies of\\napproximately $1.5 billion. In addition, for this same period, our equity and\\nequity warrant investments in public companies, which are subject to\\nvolatility based on changes in market prices, have experienced gains of\\napproximately $1.5 billion based on available trading prices. Income Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes.\\nCertain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S.\\ntaxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to\\ntax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign\\nsubsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,\\nindefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would\\nincur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences\\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as\\nwell as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at\\nenacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or\\nrecovered. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income\\ntaxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future\\nrealization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they\\nwill not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood\\nof future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent\\ncumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains\\nand investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us\\nfor tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future earnings in\\nrelevant jurisdictions more challenging. We utilize a two-step approach to\\nrecognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies).\\nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining\\nif the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the\\nposition will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals\\nor litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the\\nlargest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate\\nsettlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and\\nestimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which\\nmay not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties\\nrelated to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. 46 Table of Contents\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that\\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To\\nincrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy\\nprioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and\\nliabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs\\nother than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for\\nsimilar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical\\nor similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other\\ninputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\\nLevel 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own\\nassumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure\\nthe fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities\\nbased on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nOther marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of\\nsecurities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar\\ninstruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by\\nobservable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable\\nsecurities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We\\nhold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies.\\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these warrants had a fair value of $669\\nmillion and $3.0 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income\\n(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants\\nare primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We\\nclassify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three\\nmonths or less as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of\\nproducts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in,\\nfirst-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable\\nvalue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently\\navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through\\nsales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations,\\nand expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory\\nvaluation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $1.6 billion\\nand $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We provide Fulfillment by\\nAmazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-\\nparty sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether\\nfulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these\\nproducts are not included in our inventories. We also purchase electronic\\ndevice components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract\\nmanufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the\\nnormal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and\\nhelp ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract\\nmanufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A\\nportion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements\\nconsists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on\\nforecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur\\nadditional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain\\nproducts offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net\\nand Other 47 Table of Contents Software Development Costs We incur software\\ndevelopment costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to\\nexternal users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development\\ncosts capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other\\ncosts, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as\\nincurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at\\ncost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we\\nreceive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our\\ncosts. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property\\nwe have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control\\nover the building during the construction period and finance lease\\narrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking\\nequipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and\\namortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\\nlives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of\\nthe underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four years\\nsubsequent to January 1, 2020 for our servers, five years for networking\\nequipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other\\nfulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified\\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated\\nstatements of operations. Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms\\nlonger than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are\\ngenerally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the\\nentire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are\\nrecorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as\\noperating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten\\nyears for equipment and one to twenty years for property. Certain lease\\ncontracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations\\nand maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services\\nas a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services\\nare accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other\\nservices components based on estimated stand-alone prices. Lease liabilities\\nare recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by\\nlandlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured\\nborrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial\\npresent value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives,\\nplus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments\\nreclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold\\nimprovements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their\\nexpected useful life or the lease term. When we have the option to extend the\\nlease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or\\npurchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise\\nthe option, we consider the option in determining the classification and\\nmeasurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on\\nmeasures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the\\nlevel of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. Costs\\nassociated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis\\nwithin operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are\\namortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter\\nof the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title\\ndoes not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest\\ncomponent of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized\\nusing the effective interest method over the lease term. We establish assets\\nand liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire\\nlong-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are\\namortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded\\nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement\\ncosts. Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated\\nconstruction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control\\nover the building during the construction period. If we continue to control\\nthe building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a\\nfinancing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the\\nshorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. If we do not control\\nthe building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities\\nfor construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as either\\noperating or finance. 48 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived\\nIntangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\\nfor impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or\\ncircumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nWe may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is\\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-\\nlived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a\\nquantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and\\nindefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair\\nvalue is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an\\nimpairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the\\nreporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows\\nare based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses,\\nbased primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share,\\nand general economic conditions. We completed the required annual impairment\\ntest of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible\\nassets as of April 1, 2020, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our\\nreporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no\\nevents that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 —\\nAcquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.” Other Assets Included\\nin “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily\\nrelated to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired\\nintangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; certain equity\\ninvestments; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and lease\\nprepayments made prior to lease commencement. Digital Video and Music Content\\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and\\nmusic content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide\\nrange of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment\\nschedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is\\ndeterminable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we\\nrecognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We\\nreduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost\\nof sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing\\npatterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not\\ndeterminable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and\\nlicensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video\\ncontent for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost\\nof sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing\\npatterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of\\nour capitalized video content is 2.5 years. Our produced and licensed video\\ncontent is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film\\ngroup, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These\\nfilm groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or\\ncircumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying\\nvalue. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released\\ncontent, and music as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 were $5.8 billion and $6.8\\nbillion. Total video and music expense was $7.8 billion and $11.0 billion for\\nthe year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Total video and music expense\\nincludes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within\\nAmazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and\\nsold or rented content. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in\\nAAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\\nfixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash\\nequivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-\\nsale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in\\n“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we\\nevaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to\\nexpected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the\\ninvestment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are\\nrecorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. Equity investments in private companies\\nfor which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are\\naccounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or\\nimpairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance\\nsheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a\\nqualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our\\nassessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent\\nsales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available\\ndata. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair\\nvalue. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these investments had a carrying\\nvalue of $1.5 billion and $2.7 billion. 49 Table of Contents Equity\\ninvestments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the\\ninvestment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not\\ncontrol, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within\\n“Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings\\nor losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis\\ndifferences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized\\nin “Equity method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated\\nstatements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines\\nin fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we\\nwrite down the investment to its estimated fair value. Equity investments that\\nhave readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities”\\non our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes\\nrecognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of\\noperations. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and\\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever\\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the\\nassets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an\\nimpairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market\\nvalue of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an\\nasset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate\\nthat the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be\\nrecoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets,\\nimpairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not\\nrecoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.\\nWe measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying\\namount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for\\nsale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to\\na plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate\\ncondition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.\\nAssets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less\\ncosts to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31,\\n2019 and 2020. Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and\\nother” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to\\nleases and asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, tax-\\nrelated liabilities, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current\\ndebt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2020, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were\\n$4.3 billion and $7.6 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards\\nwere $3.3 billion and $4.7 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card\\nwhen redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect\\nto be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. Unearned\\nRevenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in\\nadvance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the\\nservice period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS\\nservices and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of\\nDecember 31, 2019 was $10.2 billion, of which $7.9 billion was recognized as\\nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 and our total unearned revenue\\nas of December 31, 2020 was $11.6 billion. Included in “Other long-term\\nliabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.0 billion and $1.9\\nbillion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Additionally, we\\nhave performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with\\ncommitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been\\nrecognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that\\nexceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $50.0 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2020. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term\\ncontracts is 3.4 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition\\nis largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original\\ncontractual term. Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term\\nliabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily\\nrelated to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, deferred tax\\nliabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music\\ncontent. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the\\nnet sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred\\nfrom those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The\\nfunctional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these\\nstores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of\\nthese subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign\\nexchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates 50\\nTable of Contents prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments\\nare included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate\\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on\\ncash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements\\nof cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany\\ntransactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of\\nthe entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and\\nremeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $(186)\\nmillion, $95 million, and $118 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Note 2 —\\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable\\nSecurities As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our cash, cash equivalents,\\nrestricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-\\nrated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities,\\nand other investment grade securities.

The combined weighted average remaining life of the Notes\\nwas 15.8 years as of December 31, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-\\nannually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from\\ntime to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to\\nany financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes\\nwas approximately $26.2 billion and $37.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and\\n2020, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. Other\\nlong-term debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest\\nrate of 4.1% and 2.9% as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We used the net\\nproceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business\\noperations. The estimated fair value of other long-term debt, which is based\\non Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and\\n2020. 56 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2020, future principal payments\\nfor our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions): Year Ended\\nDecember 31, 2021 $ 1,156 2022 1,629 2023 2,283 2024 3,355 2025 2,251\\nThereafter 22,500 $ 33,174 We also utilize other short-term credit facilities\\nfor working capital purposes.

For those\\ndigital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the\\ntotal obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the\\nreporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely\\nat the option of the content provider are included to the extent such\\ncommitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (2) Includes the\\nestimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements\\nassociated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction,\\nasset retirement obligations, and liabilities associated with digital media\\ncontent agreements with initial terms greater than one year. (3) Excludes\\napproximately $2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot\\nmake a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if\\nany. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged or\\notherwise restricted $994 million and $875 million of our cash, cash\\nequivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as\\ncollateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in\\ncertain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit.\\nAdditionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related\\nto our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.” Suppliers During 2020, no vendor\\naccounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term\\ncontracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of\\nmerchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.\\nOther Contingencies We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes\\n(such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes),\\nincluding in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes.\\nIf the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims,\\nwe could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in\\nJune 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected\\nsales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including\\ninterest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have\\ncollected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. In\\nSeptember 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of\\nthe Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court\\nof Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend\\nourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were\\nsuccessfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be\\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities. 58 Table of Contents Legal\\nProceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings,\\nand litigation, including the following: In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a\\ncomplaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services,\\nInc., and Amazon Web Services, LLC for patent infringement in the United\\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges\\nthat Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Private Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing,\\nAuto-Scaling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257,\\nentitled “System and Method for Maintaining N Number of Simultaneous\\nCryptographic Sessions Using a Distributed Computing Environment.” The\\ncomplaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced\\ndamages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was\\ntransferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of\\nWashington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review\\npetition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In\\nJanuary 2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the\\nreview petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend\\nourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2015, Eolas Technologies,\\nInc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District\\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other\\nthings, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including\\n“search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507,\\nentitled “Distributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking\\nExternal Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects\\nWithin A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement\\ntogether with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an\\namended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of\\ndamages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the\\nevent of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130-$250 million\\nin damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States\\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the\\nallegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this\\nmatter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances\\nLLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District\\nCourt for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among\\nother things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe\\nU.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using\\nConstrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an\\ninjunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing\\nroyalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We\\ndispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves\\nvigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint\\nagainst Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the\\nNorthern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that\\nAmazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both\\nentitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol,” and 7,233,978,\\nentitled “Method And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network\\nSeparate From The Data To Which The Location Information Pertains.” The\\ncomplaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’\\nfees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of\\nwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning\\nin March 2020, a number of class-action complaints were filed alleging, among\\nother things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-\\nparty sellers in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization\\nof an alleged market in online retail or other submarkets, and consumer\\nprotection and unjust enrichment claims. In March 2020, Frame-Wilson v.\\nAmazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western\\nDistrict of Washington. Beginning in April 2020, class action complaints were\\nfiled in the Superior Court of Quebec – Division of Montreal, the Ontario\\nSuperior Court of Justice, and the Federal Court of Canada against Amazon.com,\\nInc. and related entities. The complaints allege several distinct purported\\nclasses, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores\\nand consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another\\ne-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual\\ndamages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. We dispute\\nthe allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in\\nthese matters. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of\\nObjections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers\\nin a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections\\nseeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the\\npreliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend\\nourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to\\nclaims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory\\nproceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes,\\nlabor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection,\\nconsumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and\\nby third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and\\nother contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant\\nuncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows\\nfor a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular 59 Table of Contents basis,\\ndevelopments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could\\naffect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous\\naccruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and\\nchanges to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we\\ndisclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of\\nlosses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be\\nunable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially\\nresult from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final\\nresolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or\\nprove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the\\namounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business,\\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See\\nalso “Note 9 — Income Taxes.” Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock We\\nhave authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. No\\npreferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common\\nshares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 507\\nmillion, 512 million, and 518 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and\\n2020. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding,\\nincluding those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock Repurchase\\nActivity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to\\nrepurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration.\\nThere were no repurchases of common stock in 2018, 2019, or 2020.

The estimated\\nforfeiture rate as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 was 27%. Changes in\\nour estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize\\nmaterial changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During\\n2018, 2019, and 2020, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was\\n$11.4 billion, $11.7 billion, and $15.5 billion. Common Stock Available for\\nFuture Issuance As of December 31, 2020, common stock available for future\\nissuance to employees is 102 million shares. Note 9 — INCOME TAXES U.S.\\ncompanies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on\\ncertain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived\\nIntangible Income deduction (“FDII”). In addition, certain foreign subsidiary\\nearnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent\\nrepatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax\\nrules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by\\nallowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily\\nequipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of\\nfull expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election\\nfor 2020. 61 Table of Contents The components of the provision for income\\ntaxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019\\n2020 U.S. Federal: Current $ ( 129 ) $ 162 $ 1,835 Deferred 565 914 ( 151 )\\nTotal 436 1,076 1,684 U.S. State: Current 322 276 626 Deferred 5 8 ( 190 )\\nTotal 327 284 436 International: Current 563 1,140 956 Deferred ( 129 ) ( 126\\n) ( 213 ) Total 434 1,014 743 Provision for income taxes, net $ 1,197 $ 2,374\\n$ 2,863 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes are as\\nfollows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 U.S. $ 11,157 $\\n13,285 $ 20,219 International 104 691 3,959 Income before income taxes $\\n11,261 $ 13,976 $ 24,178 The items accounting for differences between income\\ntaxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for\\nincome taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019\\n2020 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate $ 2,365 $ 2,935 $\\n5,078 Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings and losses 162 453 ( 538 )\\nState taxes, net of federal benefits 263 221 343 Tax credits ( 419 ) ( 466 ) (\\n639 ) Stock-based compensation (1) ( 1,086 ) ( 850 ) ( 1,107 ) Foreign income\\ndeduction (FDII) ( 43 ) ( 72 ) ( 372 ) 2017 Impact of U.S. Tax Act ( 157 ) — —\\nOther, net 112 153 98 Total $ 1,197 $ 2,374 $ 2,863 ___________________ (1)\\nIncludes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from\\nstock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $1.6 billion, $1.4\\nbillion, and $1.8 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation\\nfor 2018, 2019, and 2020. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher\\nthan in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in\\nexcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time\\nprovisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018. Our provision\\nfor income taxes in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase\\nin pretax income. This was partially offset by the impact of developments in\\nour ongoing global tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings\\nand losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation,\\nand an increase in our foreign income deduction under FDII. In addition, our\\nLuxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred tax\\nassets previously subject to valuation allowances. We intend to invest\\nsubstantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital\\nin our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those\\njurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon\\nrepatriation of such amounts. 62 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets\\nand liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 2020 Deferred\\ntax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 188 245 Loss\\ncarryforwards - Foreign 3,232 3,876 Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other\\nexpenses 1,373 2,457 Stock-based compensation 1,585 2,033 Depreciation and\\namortization 2,385 1,886 Operating lease liabilities 6,648 10,183 Other items\\n728 559 Tax credits 772 207 Total gross deferred tax assets 16,911 21,446 Less\\nvaluation allowances (2) ( 5,754 ) ( 5,803 ) Deferred tax assets, net of\\nvaluation allowances 11,157 15,643 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and\\namortization ( 5,507 ) ( 5,508 ) Operating lease assets ( 6,331 ) ( 9,539 )\\nOther items ( 640 ) ( 1,462 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of\\nvaluation allowances $ ( 1,321 ) $ ( 866 ) ___________________ (1) Deferred\\ntax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies. (2)\\nRelates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon\\nthe generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions. Our\\nvaluation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets,\\nincluding substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as\\nof December 31, 2020. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income\\ntax purposes as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $13.4 billion before\\ntax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations\\nunder applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will\\nbegin to expire in 2021. All remaining federal tax credits, which were\\nprimarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced\\nour federal tax liability in 2020. We regularly assess whether it is more\\nlikely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing\\njurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect\\nto each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent\\ncumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains,\\nand investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us\\nfor tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future earnings more\\nchallenging. Since Q2 2017, we have recorded a valuation allowance against our\\nnet deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. There is still significant uncertainty\\nwhether our earnings in Luxembourg are sustainable in the future and we will\\nmaintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to\\nsupport a release of the valuation allowance. Tax Contingencies We are subject\\nto income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign\\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax\\npositions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary\\ncourse of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the\\nultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related\\nuncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which,\\nadditional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe\\nthat certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax\\nreturn positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of\\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The\\nprovision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and\\nchanges to reserves that are considered appropriate. 63 Table of Contents The\\nreconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): December\\n31, 2018 2019 2020 Gross tax contingencies – January 1 $ 2,309 $ 3,414 $ 3,923\\nGross increases to tax positions in prior periods 164 216 88 Gross decreases\\nto tax positions in prior periods ( 90 ) ( 181 ) ( 465 ) Gross increases to\\ncurrent period tax positions 1,088 707 507 Settlements with tax authorities (\\n36 ) ( 207 ) ( 1,207 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 21 ) ( 26 ) ( 26 )\\nGross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 3,414 $ 3,923 $ 2,820\\n___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.8\\nbillion of accrued tax contingencies of which $1.5 billion, if fully\\nrecognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. The decrease in our tax\\ncontingencies in 2020 was primarily a result of developments in our global tax\\ncontroversies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had accrued interest and\\npenalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of\\n$131 million and $83 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income\\ntax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020\\nwas $20 million, $4 million, and $(48) million. We are under examination, or\\nmay be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the\\ncalendar year 2013 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary\\ncourse adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating\\nlosses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.\\nDuring Q3 2020, we resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2012 with the\\nIRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual. In October\\n2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether\\ndecisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate\\nincome tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union\\nrules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its\\ndecision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not\\ncomply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the\\nEuropean Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately\\n€250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and\\nordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of\\nadditional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery\\namount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited\\ninto escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all\\nappeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s\\ndecision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s\\ndecision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously\\nin this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other\\nforeign jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and\\nthe United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination\\nand additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these\\nparticular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. Changes in tax\\nlaws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\\nmay impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax\\nexaminations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any,\\nupon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from\\nthe amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve\\nmonths we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or\\npossibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more\\njurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our\\ncontingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual\\namount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing\\nand nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the\\nrange of possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized\\nour operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We\\nallocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology\\nand content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage,\\nwhich is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred.\\nThe majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS\\nsegment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure\\ntechnology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North\\nAmerica segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our\\nreportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating\\ndecision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its\\noperations. 64 Table of Contents North America The North America segment\\nprimarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products\\n(including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused\\nonline and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these\\nonline stores. International The International segment primarily consists of\\namounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers)\\nand subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment\\nincludes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores\\n(including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S.,\\nMexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused\\nonline stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global\\nsales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups,\\nenterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants On\\nAccounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation\\nrequired by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the\\nsupervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and\\nprincipal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation\\nof our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the\\n1934 Act, as of December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our principal\\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of\\nDecember 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to\\nprovide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us\\nin the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded,\\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the\\nSEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such\\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on\\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for\\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\nreporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has\\nassessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as\\nof December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control —\\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,\\nmanagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding\\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\\naccounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the\\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report\\nis included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There\\nwere no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the\\nquarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably\\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance\\nof achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect,\\nhowever, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control\\nover financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any\\ncontrol system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon\\ncertain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\\nthat its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can\\nprovide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not\\noccur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the\\nCompany have been detected. 69 Table of Contents Report of Independent\\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders\\nAmazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have\\naudited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of\\nDecember 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control —\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,\\nAmazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\\nthe COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of\\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\\nand the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,\\nstockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\\nended December 31, 2020 and the related notes and our report dated February 2,\\n2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s\\nmanagement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s\\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\\nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our\\naudit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\\nall material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of\\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness\\nof internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and\\nLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\\nfinancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\nmay deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington February 2, 2021 70\\nTable of Contents Item 9B.
